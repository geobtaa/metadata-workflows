 "dc_description_s": "The North Freedom quadrangle is located on the South Range of the Baraboo Hills in south-central Wisconsin. The Baraboo Hills are recognized for their ecologic and geologic significance, with superb exposure of Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks and Quaternary sediments. Mapping focused on the Precambrian section, building on past work by subdividing and mapping members of the Baraboo Quartzite; Paleozoic units were mapped in reconnaissance; and Quaternary units and contacts were compiled and slightly modified from earlier mapping.",
