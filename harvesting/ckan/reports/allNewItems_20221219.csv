"Forest Health Survey 2022, Minnesota",,"This dataset shows where largescale tree canopy damage was delineated in aerial surveys in 2022. Only forest disturbances were mapped if they were occurring at the time of the flight. Flights occurred sporadically from early June to mid September. The following were the most common disturbers, listed from largest area disturbed to smallest area disturbed: spruce budworm, eastern larch beetle, aspen decline, unknown cause of defoliation on hardwoods and aspen, wind, forest tent caterpillar, oak wilt, flooding, unknown causes of mortality, large aspen tortrix, bark beetles on pine, larch casebearer, and twolined chestnut borer.

PWD Geotechnical Tests,,"BACKGROUND - The objective of geotechnical testing is to help determine the suitability of a site for green stormwater infrastructure. The tests are used to calculate infiltration rates at proposed green infrastructure locations and evaluate the lithology at depths sufficient to identify any hydraulically limiting layers that would inhibit vertical infiltration and potentially cause lateral flow. The testing includes drilling borings followed by infiltration testing within the footprint of each GSI system. USING THE LAYER - The infiltration rates and subsurface lithology results such as depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater may be helpful for other users of this layer, but it is important to note that these values can vary widely from location to location, even for nearby sites.
