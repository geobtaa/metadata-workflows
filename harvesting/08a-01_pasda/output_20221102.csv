Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania,2018,Allegheny College,"Digitized regional surficial geology map for northwestern Pennsylvania. The complete citation for the paper map is: Map of the Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania by V.C. Shepps, J.B. Droste, and R.F. Sitler under the supervision of G.W.White, 1959, Bulletin G-32, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. The original map was published at a scale of 1:125,000. Three counties are fully covered by these deposits and mapped (Crawford, Erie, and Mercer); five more are partially covered and mapped (Beaver, Butler, Lawrence, Warren, and Venango). 
This GIS dataset shows the areal distribution of 14 distinct glacial deposits from the Pleistocene Epoch and Recent stream alluvium and/or bedrock exposures. All mapping activity and lithologic interpretations were made by the original authors of the map (Shepps et al., 1959); the authors of this electronic geospatial resource (Shaffer et al., 2005) have only provided digital transfer of the map features and attributes and documentation of the process. Purpose:
This dataset identifies the distribution of surficial unconsolidated sediments (glacial deposits and stream alluvium) in northwestern PA. This map is the only published comprehensive regional surficial geologic map available for the region. The original map was digitized to provide an electronic version for GIS work. Potential users should read the Supplemental Information Section (below) to determine the appropriate scale for using these data. More detailed surficial geologic maps may exist within the mapped area in either paper or electronic format. Researchers are encouraged to check with the U.S. Geological Survey, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, PASDA, and/or Geology Departments at local universities and colleges for other maps.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=NWPAGlacialDeposits2018.xml

Allegheny County - Floodplain,2000,Allegheny County,"In an effort to expedite the permit review process for Water Obstruction and Encroachment Applications, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection initiated a plan to replace hard-copy maps with digital GIS sets. The project is referred to as the 105 Spatial Data System (105SDS) Pennsylvania river floodplains and coastal floodplains are two of many spatial data sets that were used in the 105SDS project. As a result of work completed by Law Environmental, Inc. on the statewide low-level radioactive waste siting project, DEP received two coverages depicting river and coastal floodplains. However, due to the process used in constructing these data sets, there were many areas throughout the state in which floodplains were not digitized. The primary purpose of this task was to complete the digital floodplain mapping in these areas. 
Purpose: INTENDED USE OF DATA; Created to do permit reviews for Water Obstruction and Encroachment Applications. LIMITATIONS OF DATA; Due to the nature of transferring the floodplains from the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps to plotted 1:24000 scale maps this coverage should be considered to be the ""best representation"" of the data but not as accurate as, for example, a map of Global Positioning System's floodplain coordinates",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=AlleghenyCounty_Floodplain2000.xml

Allegheny County - Street Centerlines,2022,Allegheny County,"This dataset contains street centerlines for vehicular and foot traffic in Allegheny County.  Street Centerlines are classified as Primary Road, Secondary Road, Unpaved Road, Limited Access Road, Connecting Road, Jeep Trail, Walkway, Stairway, Alleyway and Unknown.

A Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction.  A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction.  An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel.  A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway.  A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street.  A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together.  Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature.  A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation.  A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature.  A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed.

Centerlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement.  One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement.  Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present.

For roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement.

All attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated.  For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR.  If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004.  The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified.

The ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps.  Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed.  In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads.
Street Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset.  In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area.

Street Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area.

The Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field.  In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset.  When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004.  All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values.  All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used.  In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection.  Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range.  All new Street Centerlines will have zero (0) for ""SystemID"" and ""UserID"".",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=AlleghenyCounty_StreetCenterlines202210.xml
Allegheny County - Street Edge of Pavement,2016,Allegheny County,"Edge of Pavements are the edges of all public thoroughfares including paved roads, unpaved roads, bridges, overpasses, tunnels, alleys, stairways and airfield runways.

Paved Roads are roads that are surfaced with concrete or asphalt.  Roads that have been tarred and chipped are also considered paved.  Roads surfaced with gravel or packed dirt are considered Unpaved.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than surrounding roads that runs between, but parallel to, two paved roads.  An Alley can be either paved or unpaved.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  Road pavement edges that are underneath bridges or overpasses are coded as Hidden.  Bridges and Overpasses are delineated along the outside edge of the structure.  Portions of bridges that are under other bridges or other objects are coded as Hidden Bridge.  Tunnels are shown as lines connecting the apparent width of the tunnel through the earth.  Stairways are major pedestrian thoroughfares, either paved or wooden, connecting two (2) roads and typically found on steep hills.  Airfield Runways are the edges of Runways, Taxiways and other airfield pavement areas.  Driveways that are greater than 300' in length will be digitized and coded as either Paved Road or Unpaved Road.

Paved Road edges show the width of the paved area.  If the paved road has a paved shoulder, the paved shoulder is shown as part of the paved road.  The placement of an unpaved road is subject to interpretation by the photogrammetrist since the road edge may be indefinite due to the imprecise nature of an unpaved surface.

Driveways that are over 300' in length are digitized.  For a driveway that terminates at a building, it shall be drawn to the building.  Driveways will also have a centerline for its entire length.

Parking lots are not digitized.  The entrance to a parking lot for shopping areas shall be shown.  Driving areas around and through parking lots serving shopping areas and other businesses are considered part of the parking lot.  If the driving area through a parking lot connects to two (2) or more exterior roads, the main thoroughfare through the parking lot shall be shown as a road.

The driving area through an apartment complex or condominium complex shall be digitized as a road.  The road is needed in these areas to show access to the individual dwelling places.

Edges of Pavement that are updated will have the database field StreetCL_FC populated with the Feature Code of the Street Centerline.  (The Street Centerline Feature Code is more descriptive than the general code used for Edge of Pavement.)",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=AlleghenyCounty_StreetEOP2006.xml

"Allegheny County -Tree Canopy Change, 2010-2015",2022,Allegheny County,"Tree canopy change in Allegheny County Pennsylvania for the years 2010 to 2015. This tree canopy change data set consists of three classes: no change, gain, and loss. No change polygons are those in which the tree canopy remained the same between the two time periods. Gain polygons are those in which tree canopy increased between the two time periods. Loss polygons are those in which tree canopy decrease between the two time periods. 2010 tree canopy can be calculated by adding the “no change” and loss classes. Tree canopy for 2015 can be calculated by adding the “no change” and “gain” classes.Several data sets were used to map tree canopy change. The starting point was the 2010 high-resolution land cover data set developed for Allegheny County. Change was then mapped using leaf-off lidar data collected in 2006, 4-band leaf-on National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data collected in 2010, leaf off lidar data collected in 2015, and 4-band leaf-on NAIP data collected in 2015. All four data sets were integratedinto an object-based image analysis system (OBIA), which a rule-based expert system. A combination of segmentation, classification, and morphology algorithms were employed to determine if tree canopy had changed between the two time periods. The data set was then manually edited at a scale of 1:5000. The main factors determining change were a decrease in height, indicating tree removal, as identified by the lidar, and the change in the spectral characteristics, as identified in the aerial imagery. There were spatial misalignment issues between all four of the data sets. As a result, very fine scale changes at the edges of tree canopy could not be determined. The data set can thus be considered to be slightly biased towards tree canopy loss, and fine-scale tree canopy gains could not be determined. Most of the gain identified is not new growth, but rather canopy from trees that were too small to be detected in the original 2010 mapping.The incorporation of newer lidar data enabled a revisit of the original 2010 tree canopy mapping. The 2015 lidar data was substantially higher quality than the 2006 lidar data used for the 2010 high-resolution land cover mapping project. This enabled errors of omission and commission in the original 2010 tree canopy mapping to be corrected. Examples include shrubby areas in 2010 falsely classified as tree canopy and tall trees that were not clearly visible in the data used to map tree canopy in 2010. This data set should be considered to be the most accurate depiction of tree canopy for both the 2010 and 2015 time periods.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=AlleghenyCounty_TreeCanopyChange_2010_2015_202207.xml

Allegheny County: Landscape Ecology and Green Infrastructure,2006,Carnegie Mellon University,"The 3 Rivers 2nd Nature project was directed by artists/researchers Tim Collins and Reiko Goto. The project addressed the meaning, form, and function of public space and nature in Allegheny County, PA, U.S.A. This is the region that encompasses the former steel industry capital of the United States, Pittsburgh PA, U.S.A. 3 Rivers 2nd Nature focused upon the three major rivers; the Allegheny, the Monongahela, and the Ohio Rivers, as well as the streams and subwatersheds. This five-year project revisited questions of nature and post-industrial public space, first addressed on the Nine Mile Run Greenway Project. The focus of the work is research to benefit the public realm, applied as strategic knowledge with accompanying outreach programs intended to enable creative public advocacy and change.

The 3 Rivers 2nd Nature conducted integrative analysis and instrumental planning based upon the rigorous field studies that began in the year 2000. The work effort focused upon partnerships to accomplish interdisciplinary analysis, spatial mapping, and concept design within and among specific communities. The work culminated with an ecological design plan and a water quality policy report that analyzed alternatives for ongoing water quality sampling. Finally, the project team has organized the ""Monongahela Conferences"" and the subsequent 2005 ""Groundworks"" exhibition (October 2005) to examine the artist's role in social and environmental change.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=3Rivers_Data.xml

Chesapeake Bay Watershed land use/land cover v105,2000,Chesapeake Bay Program,"A land cover map of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed plus the non-watershed components of counties that intersect the Watershed. The map has 17 cover classes modified from the Anderson Level II system. Landsat remotely sensed data and additional thematic data bases were used to create the map. A decision-tree classification was used, together with ad hoc algorithms to improve local accuracies. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were acquired for three seasons. The spatial accuracy is nominally 30m, but accuracy increases rapidly at larger minimum mapping units and, as a general rule, the map should not be used below 1ha (100m x 100m) resolution.

Cultural Assessment of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,2000,Chesapeake Bay Program,"Multiple TIFF and layer files pertaining to Cultural Assessment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed Growth and development not only threaten lands of high value for water quality and habitat, but also cultural lands that directly connect many citizens in the Bay watershed to the land. Important in preserving heritage and traditional values, cultural lands often define sense of place. The objective of the cultural assessment is to identify lands that provide cultural assets and further inform preservation efforts with spatial information about cultural lands. This spatial information about cultural resources can provide an added value to land preservation because cultural lands provide a historic perspective for interpreting land and people's relationship with it. Additionally, the value of an historic or cultural site is often intrinsically tied to the landscape context in which it is located.

This considers not only the potential economic return from forest harvest operations, but also the long-term economic sustainability of forest land management and the local importance of the timber management and wood products industry. Other economic benefits related to forest lands, such as tourism and hunting, are not considered in this model. MORE INFORMATION -",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=chesapeakebayforesteconomics.xml
Landscape Ecological Assessment of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,2000,Chesapeake Bay Program,"Multiple TIFF and layer files pertaining to Landscape ecological assessment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape. I found that much of the watershed was still fairly intact, although this varied dramatically by ecoregion. Current protection also varied, and an assessment of vulnerability will help focus protection efforts among the most valuable hubs and corridors.

Philadelphia Census Block Groups,2010,City of Philadelphia,"The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Some boundary details clarified by Philadelphia City Planning Commission May 2011",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.xml
Philadelphia Census Tracts,2000,City of Philadelphia,"Census bureau statistical units.  Most commonly used statistical unit.

Philadelphia Census Tracts 2010,2010,City of Philadelphia,"Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at ten square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 Orthophotography and 2008 LiDAR LAS data.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (building footprints, road polygons, and hydrography) provided by City of Philadelphia. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2008. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing.

Philadelphia Water - PWD Parcels,2022,City of Philadelphia,"The primary purpose of PWD_PARCEL layer is to calculate parcel-based stormwater charges for PWD customers under the new parcel-based stormwater billing program.  The layer was created from the DOR_PARCELS layer in 2005 after it was decided that none of the other City parcel layers could meet the needs of PWD's stormwater billing program.  Those needs are generally that the parcel delineations match up to what people actually own, that there is an accurate assessment of the impervious area on the parcel, and that there is owner information associated with the parcel.  Over the past 5 years, PWD has made corrections based off deeds on file with DOR, BRT information, and other City records.  PWD also matched up each DOR parcel to a corresponding BRT record that contained the owner information for that parcel.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PhillyWater_PWD_PARCELS2022.xml

United States Protected Areas (PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition)),2010,Conservation Biology Institute,"Protected areas are cornerstones of national and international conservation strategies. By way of these designations, lands and waters are set-aside in-perpetuity to preserve functioning natural ecosystems, act as refuges for species, and maintain ecological processes. Complementary conservation strategies preserve land for the sustainable use of natural resources, or for the protection of significant geologic and cultural features or open space. PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) attempts to include all available spatial data on these places. It is our goal to publish the most comprehensive geospatial data set of U. S. protected areas to date.  

PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) is limited to the continental U.S.,  Alaska, and Hawaii. It does not include protected areas data for U.S. territories at this time.

The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) data set portrays the nation's protected areas with a standardized spatial geometry and numerous valuable attributes on land ownership, management designations, and conservation status (using national GAP and international IUCN coding systems).  The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) defines protected area to include all lands dedicated to the preservation of biology diversity and to other natural, recreation and cultural uses, and managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means (adapted from IUCN definition). The database represents the full range of conservation designations that preserve these natural resources in the United States. Our database does not distinguish a protection threshold above which biodiversity is considered secure. Instead, a complete suite of protected area attributes are provided for each polygon with the purpose of giving users the information they need to define the most relevant conservation thresholds for their own objectives and requirements.  Collaborating with the nation's leading data providers, the goal is to provide an annual update.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=UnitedStatesProtectedAreas2010.xml

"DVRPC Historic Digital Imagery (multiple years) 1959, 1965-1995",1959 - 1995,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,"Prior to the year 2000, DVRPC’s aerial imagery consisted of mylar aerial photo
enlargements or “atlas sheets”. These atlas sheets were produced from 9x9"" aerial
photos. The imagery dates from the years 1959, 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990,
& 1995. The 1959s and 1965s primarily cover the urbanized portion of
the DVRPC region (the DVRPC region is made up of nine counties: Bucks, Chester,
Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; Burlington, Camden,
Gloucester, and Mercer in New Jersey). Subsequent years provide full coverage of the
region, minus the occasional missing scan.
In order to increase the efficiency of using the historical aerial imagery, the sheets were
scanned into TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files. Each TIFF file ranges between 35-
40MB in size. Unlike DVRPC’s more recent aerial imagery (2000 and later), the
historical aerials are not “orthorectified” or “orthocorrected”. In other words, they are
simply aerial images with no spatial reference or uniform scale. Through the process of
georeferencing, the scanned images can be assigned a spatial reference which will
enable them to be used more readily in a GIS environment. That said, georeferencing is
not orthorectifying or orthocorrecting. What it does allow is for the scan to be displayed
relative to other spatially referenced GIS layers. A georeferenced scan does not have
the properties of an actual orthoimage. Whereas an orthoimage can be used for making
accurate measurements, a georeferenced image cannot, as it does not have the spatial
accuracy and uniform scale of an orthoimage.

Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture,2006,Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture,"The Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture (EBTJV) is the nation's first pilot project under the National Fish Habitat Initiative, which directs locally-driven efforts that build private and public partnerships to improve fish habitat. The long-term goals of the EBTJV are to develop a comprehensive restoration and education strategy to improve aquatic habitat, to raise education awareness, and to raise federal, state and local funds for brook trout conservation.

In 2005, in recognition of the need to address regional and range-wide threats to brook trout, a group of public and private entities formed the EBTJV to halt the decline of brook trout and restore fishable populations. The group spearheaded a range-wide assessment of brook trout populations and threats to brook trout and brook trout habitat in the Eastern United States (report forthcoming). Seventeen states are currently drafting strategies to prioritize policy changes and on-the-ground actions to improve water quality and restore brook trout habitat and populations in their individual state using locally-driven, incentive-based, and non-regulatory programs.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=EBTJV.xml

FEMA Historic Flood Maps,2015,Federal Emergency Management Agency,"FEMA Historic Products - Once a FIRM or FIS has been superseded by a new version, it will be categorized as a Historic Product. After they move to this status, these products are no longer official and binding under the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program). However, Historic Products may serve as valuable reference information and provide a record of an area's changing flood risks over time. They are made available on the Map Service Center for these purposes. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) that were issued to amend Historic Products when they were still effective are also listed here. A LOMC is a formal document that communicates an official modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMCs are issued in place of a physical alteration and re-publication of the map. Regulatory Mapping Products Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - The official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. Full FIRM panels are quite large (36' x 25.875'), so most users will prefer to print out a smaller selected portion called a FIRMette. This can be accomplished by selecting ""View"" once you have located your FIRM or by using the FIRMette - Desktop application. Flood Insurance Study (FIS) - A compilation and presentation of flood risk data for specific watercourses, lakes and coastal flood hazard areas within a community. The FIS report provides a detailed written account of a flood hazard mapping study and its findings. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) - Documents, including different types of Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) and Letters of Map Amendment (LOMA), that are issued by FEMA to revise or amend the flood hazard information shown on the FIRM without requiring the FIRM to be physically revised and republished. In addition, FEMA issues a formal determination letter, called a LOMC Revalidation or LOMC-VALID letter - when one or more previously issued LOMCs are found to still be valid during a new flood mapping study of an area. Revalidation letters are included in the LOMC product results on this site.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=FEMA_PA_Historic_Flood_Maps.xml

Montgomery County Planning Commission provided in-kind funding for the project as well as completing the assessment portion in Montgomery Count. Heritage Conservancy completed the assessment for the areas in Bucks County and Philadelphia County. Both organizations then mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers. The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams. The 1' pixel resolution 2010 aerials from DVRPC served as the basis for the riparian conditions along the waterways. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). This dataset is an assessment of the same area completed back in 200-2004. The same methodology of creating 50 foot buffers from the edge of water to assess the tree cover in this area was used. The stream centerline is used to represent the classification of whether one side, both sides, or neither side has tree cover. In addition to the three categories from the previous assessment, the category of culvert was added to incorporate areas where there was not an opportunity for tree cover.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=RiparianBufferAssessment_2012.xml

The conservancy then assessed various watersheds in southeastern Pennsylvania and mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers.  The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams.

Interpretation of 1"" = 400' black-and-white high altitude aerial photographs, Orthophotos, and videotape from helicopter over flights were used to determine the presence or absence of a forested buffer for 1,200 miles of stream. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS).

A series of large-scale (1"" = 400') maps were produced showing sections of stream bank lacking forest buffers. Local conservation groups were given the maps to assist them in targeting areas for riparian buffer plantings to improve water quality.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=paseriparianbuffers.xml
Riparian Streams - Berks County,2007,Heritage Conservancy,"This is a county wide analysis of Berks County waterways to determine riparian buffer values given a 50 ft., 50% canopy coverage requirement.

The analysis was done by first overlaying the stream shapefile on the orthophotos.  Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added.  Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile.  The canopy coverage percentage was interpreted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement.  At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none).  

   - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream.
   - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.
   - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.

The threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft.  If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines.  Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline.  In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides.

Ponds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis.  Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value.  

Edits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious.  The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes.  The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines.  

Stream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value.  

Ten sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=Heritage_BerksRiparianStreams2007.xml

Spatial data contained herein represent the administrative boundary of the Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River (UPDE) as defined in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan. The data are intended for general GIS analysis, display, planning, and reference purposes only. The spatial data contained herein are a digital representation of the Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River's administrative boundary. These digital data were derived from the official version of the boundary as represented in hard-copy form in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan, as approved in the 1987 Record of Decision. The plan boundary, which was established to meet the resource protection requirements set forth in the Wild and Scenic Rvers Act and in the Special Statutory Provisions for the Upper Delaware, was delineated so as to encompass ""lands from which runoff drains directly into the river and tributary drainages upstream to the first prominent topographic feature"" (River Management Plan, 1986). The authoritative area of the boundary as given in the 1986 River Management Plan is 55,574.5 acres. At present, the National Park Service owns approximately 31 acres within the boundary, and the remaining land is mostly privately owned, with some state and local government holdings. The boundary was digitized based on the eight pages of maps from the River Management Plan georeferenced to 7.5 minute quadrangle topo maps from the USGS Historical Topographic Map Collection.

The plan boundary, which was established to meet the resource protection requirements set forth in the Wild and Scenic Rvers Act and in the Special Statutory Provisions for the Upper Delaware, was delineated so as to encompass ""lands from which runoff drains directly into the river and tributary drainages upstream to the first prominent topographic feature"" (River Management Plan, 1986). The authoritative area of the boundary as given in the 1986 River Management Plan is 55,574.5 acres. At present, the National Park Service owns approximately 31 acres within the boundary, and the remaining land is mostly privately owned, with some state and local government holdings.

Grasslands - Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion,2010,Natural Lands Trust,"This raster dataset has been created using the PAMAP Program Land Cover for Pennsylvania, 2005 (downloaded from PASDA) and Landscape Blocks as originated by The Nature Conservancy. 

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value.

Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Grasslands vegetation cover (Pasture/Grass) from the 2005 land cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the Grasslands land cover that overlap with the road buffers.

This data set was created solely to calculate the impervious cover change between 1985 and 2000.

Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation®. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the expanded piedmont ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data.

Interior Forest - Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion,2010,Natural Lands Trust,"This raster dataset has been created using the PAMAP Program Land Cover for Pennsylvania, 2005 (downloaded from PASDA) and Landscape Blocks as originated by The Nature Conservancy. 

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value.

Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads.

The road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Using an inside buffer of 300 feet on the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) from the 2005 land cover, the interior forest raster was created. Acreage of the contiguous interior forest was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows:

Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Natural vegetation cover (Water, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, Woody Wetland, and Emergent Wetland) from the 1992 land Cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the contiguous natural vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows:

Ability to Produce Clean and Abundant Water - version 2,2016,Open Space Institute,"In the original APCAW (v2) the Open Space Institute (OSI) sought to develop a metric to measure the relative capacity of small scale (HUC12) watersheds to produce clean surface and ground water. In 2014, two different HUC12-based metrics (i.e., “Ability to Produce Good Quality Surface Water” and “Ability to Produce Good Quality Ground Water”) were calculated and used by OSI to evaluate land protection projects. In 2015, OSI combined these two metrics into one metric that considers watershed conditions (e.g. land cover, terrain, and hydrology) and their effects on the abundance and quality of surface and ground water within a reasonably-sized watershed (i.e., HUC12 boundary).

Delaware River Watershed Initiative - Soils,2015,Open Space Institute,"Two seamless soils datasets based on USDA’s SSURGO and STATSGO databases were created for the entire DRB region, and information pertaining to various soil-related factors such as erodibility (k factor), available water - holding capacity, texture, etc. were compiled and summarized for discrete mapping units at these two scales. The SSURGO (Soil Survey Geographic) database is compiled at the detailed county-level survey scale that most soil information users are familiar with, and has two basic components: 1) digital boundaries of the detailed soil mapping units, and 2) tabular information on a wide range of soil parameters associated with each mapping unit. The STATSGO (State Soil Geographic) database summarizes similar soils information at a much more generalized “soil association” scale. Both of these datasets for the DRB area were downloaded from USDA’s “geospatial data” site at http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov. Once downloaded, considerable effort was then expended to first 
seam together the data from the separate states overlapping the DRB, and then to “populate” both soil databases by linking a number of “attribute tables” to the soils polygons contained within the DRB boundary. In this case, over 325,000 soil polygons were populated with information extracted from about a dozen different attribute tables.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=DelawareRiverWatershedInitiative_Soils201502.xml

Bedrock Geology of Pennsylvania,2001,Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,"Two digital data sets, one for geologic units and faults and the other for dikes, have been
prepared for Pennsylvania. The data sets were digitized primarily from the artwork used
for the 1980 ""Geologic Map of Pennsylvania"" (Berg, T. M., Edmunds, W. E., Geyer,
A. R., and others, compilers, 1980, Geologic map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania
Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 1, scale 1:250,000) and from source materials used for
that map. Many of the source materials had been published as page-sized maps and were
digitized from this published paper copy (Berg, T. M., and Dodge, C. M., 1981, Atlas of
preliminary geologic quadrangle maps of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey,
4th ser., Map 61, scale approx. 1:62,500). The other source materials consist of
unpublished and published maps at various scales. It was beyond the scope of the project
to incorporate revisions that had been made to the geologic units since the 1980 map was
compiled; however, some updates to formational contacts, faults, and dikes, as well as to
geologic nomenclature and ages, were incorporated where the revisions could be easily
made.

The 1980 Pennsylvania state geologic map (Berg and others, 1980) shows the areal
distribution of 194 bedrock geologic units. The units range in geologic age from
Quaternary to Precambrian and encompass a wide variety of lithologies. The map was
compiled and published in a transverse mercator projection at 1:250,000 scale. The two
digital data sets include 195 geologic units, which, for the most part, closely correspond to
those shown on the 1980 map. The data sets were prepared using ArcInfo software and
are provided in a geographic coordinate system (units in decimal degrees). Although it is
possible to portray digital data at any scale, the geologic formational contacts, faults, and
dikes represented in these data sets are not intended to be used at any scale finer than
1:250,000.

The polygon attributes in the data set for geologic contacts and faults include unit
number, map symbol, name, age, and three lithology categories that represent the general
lithologic makeup of each geologic unit. Each arc (line) in the data set is attributed as
one or more of the three general categories of contact, fault, or border. Contact lines are
attributed according to the type of contact shown on the 1980 map (solid, dashed,
queried, or arbitrary). Fault lines are similarly attributed (solid, dashed, or queried).
Borders are attributed as either state boundaries, quadrangle boundaries, or the shoreline
of Lake Erie. The data set for dikes consists of arcs attributed with unit number, map
symbol, name, age, lithology, and type of dike (solid or dashed).

It is anticipated that the digital data sets will be used for a variety of regional or statewide
geographic-information-system applications, including water-resource and environmental
studies, conservation and ecosystem management, mineral exploration, and regional land
use planning and development.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=dcnr_bedrockgeology2001.xml

Digital data set of mapped karst features in south-central and southeastern Pennsylvania,2007,Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,"This point dataset represents an (incomplete) inventory of karst features (herein categorized as sinkholes, surface depressions, surface mines, or cave entrances) that have been cataloged in Pennsylvania by the staff of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey since 1985. County-wide karst-feature inventories for fourteen counties (Adams, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and York) were originally released as hard-copy open file reports by the agency. The user of this dataset would be well served to consult one of those reports for specifics on how the inventories were conducted. Data are also provided from incidental reports of karst features as well as partial or cursory inventories in eight additional counties (Bedford, Blair, Clinton, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lycoming, and Mifflin). 

The majority of these features were identified on contact prints of USDA, USGS, and other aerial photography. Photo locations were then transferred to paper copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles where the coordinates for the locations were determined using a constantly evolving array of technologies from mylar overlay grids, through early proprietary mapping software and more recently with GIS and GPS technology. . Some features in urbanized areas were identified via questionnaires that were sent to the municipalities in the counties being inventoried. The locations of surface mines and cave entrances were garnered from historical geological publications. 

Locations of historical iron mines and other activities often associated with karst features were garnered from historical geological publications. 

Field surveys were undertaken to establish protocol for future mapping efforts as well as to verify the field presence of interpreted features. Field verified sites are not identified in the data set.

Karst features change considerably over time. Sinkholes become filled or subsidence is repaired. One of the motivations for the karst inventory program was the rapid development taking place in many of the counties where karst could be a problem. Development obliterates much of the evidence for underlying karst features.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=DCNR_PAKarst.xml

"Late Wisconsinan Glacial Border 1:100,000",1995,Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,"Late in 1994, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey was
asked to develop a digital physiographic provinces map at 1:100,000 scale. The
then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at
1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic
provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having
20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned
using  published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic
interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was
used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New
scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian
Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision
of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and
transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section
boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the
mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with
physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late
Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries

"Physiographic Provinces 1:100,000",1995,Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,"Late in 1994, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey was
asked to develop a digital physiographic provinces map at 1:100,000 scale. The
then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at
1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic
provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having
20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned
using  published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic
interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was
used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New
scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian
Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision
of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and
transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section
boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the
mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with
physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late
Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries
in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset
containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the
late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section
boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other
datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional
work.
A companion dataset consisting of the state and county boundaries of Pennsylvania
was compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000-scale
digital-line-graph (DLG) files for boundaries. The dataset has been attributed

Preliminary Landform Subdivisions of Pennsylvania,1998,Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,"The land surface of Pennsylvania is anything but flat and horizontal.  The surface comprises complex arrangements of differences in elevation above mean sea level.  The spatial arrangement of these elevation differences comprises topography.  Topography that has describable uniformity throughout some areal dimension is termed a landform.  Landforms can be classified, boundaries can be drawn, and a map can be created.  A preliminary landform map was compiled at approximately 1:605,500 scale.  The map has four levels of landform subdivision: province, section, region, and district.  These units range in size from many hundreds of square miles (province) to less than 200 square miles (district).  The greatest topographic similarity for a given landform unit occurs in the smallest subdivision (district). The greatest topographic dissimilarity for a given landform unit occurs in the largest subdivision (province).
The landform map was digitized using ARC/INFO software.  Polygon attributes include name of physiographic province, section, district, and area, and the numerical designation of the landform unit.  Arcs were attributed according to whether they form the boundary of one or more of the following: province, section, region, district, or state.
These data sets are preliminary and will be superseded in 1999 by more detailed data sets prepared from 1:50,000-scale compilation maps having five levels of landform subdivision.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=pags_landform98.xml

Environmental Justice Areas 2005,2005,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. 
Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. 
Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. 
Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=eja_v.xml

"Historic Oil and Gas well locations from Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management PADEP – WPA Mines, K Sheet, H Sheet",2013,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"These well locations were derived from historical mine maps known as the WPA, Ksheet, and Hsheet collections. These locations are provided for informational purposes only and should not be sole means of decision making and are in no way a substitute for actual on the ground observation. In 1859, the United States’ first commercial oil well was drilled in Venango County, Pennsylvania. In the 150 years subsequent to this, an unknown number of oil and gas wells have been drilled in the state. A current estimate by the Independent Petroleum Association of America places that number at approximately 325,000. Of those 325,000 wells, over 200,000 are still unaccounted for. As these wells are found and verified, they are cataloged in the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) Abandoned and Orphan Well database to facilitate plugging. There are currently over 8,200 wells listed in this database (2013). With so many unknown oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania and the environmental threats that they pose, identification remains a vital component of DEP’s Oil and Gas Program. Currently, the DEP, Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and geo-referencing. These maps, which vary in age, not only contain information on historic mine locations, but also oil and gas locations. Through collaboration between the Bureau of Mining Programs and the Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management, potential oil and gas well locations were assembled using three mine map collections. These collections include the WPA mine map collection, Ksheets collection, and the Hsheets collection. From these sources, over 30,000 potential historic oil and gas well locations were derived. The Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management is constantly looking for historic sources to help locate oil and gas wells in the state that remain unaccounted for. This particular dataset was created using georeferenced mine maps of various/unknown accuracy and various/unknown coordinate systems to various base maps, including but not limited to USGS topographic maps and PAMAP aerial photography. The locations were then digitized using the georeferenced mine maps.

Land Recycling Cleanup Locations,2022,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"Land Recycling Cleanup Location

Land Recycling Cleanup Locations (LRCL) are divided into one or more sub-facilities categorized as media: Air, Contained Release or Abandoned Container, Groundwater, Sediment, Soil, Surface Water, and Waste. Media is the environmental resource that is associated with the cleanup effort. The following primary facility kinds describe the Acts from which cleanup locations are derived:

Act2 Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards
The first declaration of Section 102 of the policy provides a brief description of the purpose of Act2: 

The elimination of public health and environmental hazards on existing commercial and industrial land across this Commonwealth is vital to their use and reuse as sources of employment, housing, recreation, and open-space areas. The reuse of industrial land is an important component of a sound land use policy that will help prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open-space areas and natural areas and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure.

CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund
This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: 

Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur 
Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding 
Evaluate damages to natural resources 

HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act

[This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners.

Other
The Other primary facility kind includes a mixture of various different cleanup sites, no further action sites, and potential sites. This is optional data that the regional offices are not required to maintain.

STSP Storage Tank Spill and Prevention Act

The zone extends inland from the shoreline only to extend necessary to control shorelands, the uses of which have a direct and significant impact on the coastal waters.  The boundary is used as a starting point by persons or agencies to determine if their proposed activities will affect the coastal zones, and are subject to review by the Pennsylvania Coastal Zone Management Program.  Further, local municipalities, authorities, state agencies and certain non-profit organizations within these boundaries are eligible for Coastal Zone grants to support the goals and objectives of the Act at the local and state level.

Federal actions (eg. federal development activities, federal permits and licenses, federal assistance, and Outer Continental Shelf activities) occurring within the coastal boundary, or outside the boundary but impacting upon it, are subject to the federal consistency review requirements of the Act.

Pennsylvania DEP Mine Maps,2012,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"Coal mining has occurred in Pennsylvania for over a century. The maps of these coal mines are stored at various public and private locations (if they still exist at all) throughout the commonwealth. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and digitization. The DEP has tried to preserve the historic information contained on these maps by scanning the maps into a digital image. The preferred format for archiving these maps is an uncompressed Tagged Image File Format (.TIF) at 400 DPI resolution and 24-bit RGB color depth. Some archival images are stored at a lower DPI due to scanner limitations and/or extremely large size of the original hardcopy. Various scanners were used at different locations at different times. Detailed metadata on the individual map sheets can be found in the Pennsylvania Historic Underground Mine Map Inventory System (PHUMMIS). Many of the mine map images have been georeferenced after an archive image is made. These maps have been georeferenced to provide the approximate spatial location so that they can be used for many environmental related issues, including mine land reclamation and determination of needs for Mine Subsidence Insurance. It is understood that there is an inherit loss of accuracy in the georeferencing process and the georeferenced map may not align correctly with base maps and/or established coordinate systems. Therefore these georeferenced maps should ONLY be used for reference information only and NOT be used for an engineering and/or human safety related issues.

Pennsylvania DEP Mine Maps  - Tile Index,2022,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"Coal mining has occurred in Pennsylvania for over a century. The maps of these coal mines are stored at various public and private locations (if they still exist at all) throughout the commonwealth. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and digitization. The DEP has tried to preserve the historic information contained on these maps by scanning the maps into a digital image. The preferred format for archiving these maps is an uncompressed Tagged Image File Format (.TIF) at 400 DPI resolution and 24-bit RGB color depth. Some archival images are stored at a lower DPI due to scanner limitations and/or extremely large size of the original hardcopy. Various scanners were used at different locations at different times. Detailed metadata on the individual map sheets can be found in the Pennsylvania Historic Underground Mine Map Inventory System (PHUMMIS). Many of the mine map images have been georeferenced after an archive image is made. These maps have been georeferenced to provide the approximate spatial location so that they can be used for many environmental related issues, including mine land reclamation and determination of needs for Mine Subsidence Insurance. It is understood that there is an inherit loss of accuracy in the georeferencing process and the georeferenced map may not align correctly with base maps and/or established coordinate systems. Therefore these georeferenced maps should ONLY be used for reference information only and NOT be used for an engineering and/or human safety related issues.

Stormwater 167,2022,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"Stormwater management involves the control of water that runs off the surface of the land from rain or melting ice or snow. The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code.

Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) - Lakes,2022,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"The Clean Water Act Section 303(d) establishes the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program.

The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources.
This layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them.  Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.

Pennsylvania HAZUS - County Summary Reports,2007,Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency,"In 2006, PEMA completed a statewide study of a 100 year flood event using FEMA's HAZUS-MH risk analysis software.  In 2007, PEMA concluded a broader statewide study using the latest version of HAZUS-MH MR 2.0 that includes damage estimates for 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 year flood events. The study computed damages in dollars for total economic loss, building and content damage, and other economic impacts. The study also estimated the number of damaged homes and the degree of damage to those homes.
 
With these results, Statewide GIS shapefiles for economic losses and damaged homes were created for each flood scenario using ArcMap 9.1. These files can be displayed using ArcMap 9.0 or higher version - you do not need the HAZUS software to use them. They can be overlaid on other GIS maps (county, local roads, street maps, municipal maps, etc) to show the location and extent of potential flood damages for each of the flood severity levels.
 
The Flood Study maps and information contained in these files can by used local emergency management agencies, GIS and planning departments, watershed organizations, and other interested parties for hazard identification and risk assessment, mitigation planning, and flood response training activities.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: These files are estimates of damages and locations generated by the FEMA HAZUS flood analysis model. These files do not include all possible flood risk areas and are not based on actual past flood events. The data should not be used to determine regulated floodplain areas or the location of individual homes and buildings.
 
The GIS files for the various flood events have been compressed (ZIP files) and can be downloaded from this webpage. The size of the files range from 4 MBs to 25 MBs - download time may be considerable depending on the speed of your Internet connection. Contained in each ZIP file are Pennsylvania Statewide Flood Study ARCGIS shapefiles generated with the HAZUS Multihazard Flood Risk Analysis program.
 
The shapefiles represent all census blocks affected by each flood event. The economic loss layer shows total losses in thousands of dollars. The damaged homes layer shows the number of flood-affected residential structures. Additional information for each layer is contained in its attribute table which can be viewed and edited in ArcMap. The display can also be modified or enhanced by changing the layer's properties in ArcMap (change the display to ""classified"" and the number of classes to ""10,"" for example).",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PAhazus.xml
Pennsylvania HAZUS - Damaged Homes 100yr,2007,Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency,"In 2006, PEMA completed a statewide study of a 100 year flood event using FEMA's HAZUS-MH risk analysis software.  In 2007, PEMA concluded a broader statewide study using the latest version of HAZUS-MH MR 2.0 that includes damage estimates for 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 year flood events. The study computed damages in dollars for total economic loss, building and content damage, and other economic impacts. The study also estimated the number of damaged homes and the degree of damage to those homes.
 
With these results, Statewide GIS shapefiles for economic losses and damaged homes were created for each flood scenario using ArcMap 9.1. These files can be displayed using ArcMap 9.0 or higher version - you do not need the HAZUS software to use them. They can be overlaid on other GIS maps (county, local roads, street maps, municipal maps, etc) to show the location and extent of potential flood damages for each of the flood severity levels.

Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas,1994,Pennsylvania Game Commission,"Part of the Pennsylvania Gap Analysis Project the Breeding Bird Atlas database indicates bird species and nesting behavior of known birds species in Pennsylvania. The database is organized into two primary segments; the block and the species lists (data). Blocks are defined by a code for the USGS topographic map, and the block number. All records are organized by the Atlas region. Various attributes of the Atlas block are incorporated, including geographic features (physiographic locations), effort (hours of fieldwork). The species segment, being replicated the full 320,000 times, was kept to a minimal size, and lists only the species and breeding code, the year and comment. Evidence of birds nesting within an Atlas block was recorded with a set of codes that describe behavior and physical evidence of nesting. These codes are divided into four hierarchical categories, three of which indicate breeding. ""Observed,"" ""Possible,"" ""Probable,"" and ""Confirmed"" breeding codes represent increasing evidence that nesting occurred within the block a species was recorded. ""Probable"" and ""Confirmed"" categories were further segregated into hierarchical codes that represent individual breeding behaviors or physical evidence of nesting. A description of breeding codes may be provided upon request. All of Pennsylvania's 4,928 atlas ""blocks"" were surveyed, with an average of 65 species per block recorded. A total of 188 breeding species were documented statewide. Data catalogued geographically by atlas ""block,"" USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, county, and physiographic province. Species files include political status designation and a number of life-history characteristics.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=pabba1994.xml
Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas - Second,2016,Pennsylvania Game Commission,"Twenty years after the first Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania was published, the Second Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania brings our knowledge of the state’s bird populations up to date, documenting current distribution and changes in status for nearly two hundred breeding bird species. More than two thousand dedicated birdwatchers completed surveys of birds across the state from 2004 to 2009. The data amassed reveal the distribution of each species and show changes in distribution since the publication of the first Atlas. The core results of the project are the distribution maps. In fact, up to three maps per species show in fine detail the current distribution of all breeding birds based on the second Atlas, changes in distribution since the first Atlas, and, for more than one hundred species, their density across Pennsylvania.The field project was based at Powdermill Nature Reserve, environmental research center of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Rector, Pennsylvania. Bob Mulvihill and Mike Lanzone were project co-coordinators. Following the recommendations of the North American Ornithological Atlas Committee, the basic survey unit was the “block,” defined as one-sixth of a standard U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map, of which 4,937 were identified for survey coverage. Local coordination was provided by volunteer Regional Coordinators, who provided the foundation for organizing fieldwork. Eventually, 83 individuals served as Regional Coordinators (see the list under the Credits tab).Breeding bird atlases employ a set of codes to record the behaviors associated with nesting activity, ranging from the simplest detection by sight or sound, through confirmation of active nests and fledged young. Birds observed in breeding habitat, and within their particular breeding season, were placed in one of four categories based on breeding evidence — observations outside breeding habitat, or Possible, Probable, or Confirmed breeding — with a two-letter code used for confirmed breeding evidence and single letter codes for all other categories (See Project Methods – Breeding Codes). The second Atlas did not recommend undue effort to confirm breeding of common species, because it was believed that the field time could be better spent compiling species lists from multiple blocks. Obtaining confirmed breeding evidence was stressed for species identified in a particular conservation or priority category or for species simply rare or unexpected within the block.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PABBA_2nd.xml

consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas
that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that
can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped.  The soil
maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed
soil survey maps.  Where more detailed soil survey maps are
not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and
climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing
Satellite (LANDSAT) images.  Soils of like areas are studied,
and the probable classification and extent of the soils are
determined.

Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by
transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and
expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map
unit.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data.  The map data are collected in 1-
by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and
distributed as statewide coverages.  The soil map units are
linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record

The TauDEM extension (D-Infinity tools) for ArcMap was used to create flow direction, slope, and contributing area rasters. TWI was then calculated using the following equation: Ln (Contributing Area/Slope). The methodology was described by Cody Fink in his 2013 thesis entitled Dynamic Soil Property Change in Response to Natural Gas Development in Pennsylvania. TWI results in a dimensionless raster and should be displayed using a red (low values representing no flow) to blue (high, representing high probability flowpaths) color gradient.

Bluff Crest shapefile for the Pennsylvania Lake Erie shoreline 2015,2021,The Pennsylvania State University,"The goal of this project is to apply the latest in remote sensing technology to map the Lake Erie shoreline in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has 77 miles of Lake Erie shoreline contanined entirely within Erie County. Most of the shoreline consists of bluff geomorphologies ranging in height from 5 to 180 feet above the lake level. A bluff is a high bank or bold headland with a broad precipitous cliff face overlooking a lake or sea. Notable exceptions include the mouths of major tributaries and Presque Isle, adjacent to the City of Erie.

Erie PA Watersheds - major subsheds,2021,The Pennsylvania State University,"The Erie PA Watershed mapping will consist of the following hydrological units i.e. watersheds and subwatersheds covering river systems draining large hydrologic unit regions, all attributed by a standard nomenclature. A hydrologic unit is a drainage area delineated to nest in a multi-level, hierarchical drainage system.  Its boundaries are defined by hydrographic and topographic criteria that delineate an area of land upstream from a specific point on a river, stream or similar surface waters.  A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points. Hydrologic units are only synonymous with classic watersheds when their boundaries include all the source area contributing surface water to a single defined outlet point.

Floodplains of Pennsylvania,1996,The Pennsylvania State University,"In an effort to expedite the permit review process for Water
Obstruction and Encroachment Applications, the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection has initiated a plan to replace hard-copy maps

System /8105SDS/9
Pennsylvania river floodplains and coastal floodplains are two of many
spatial data sets that were used in the 105SDS project. As a result of work
completed by Law Environmental, Inc. on the statewide low-level radioactive
waste siting project, DEP received two coverages depicting river and
coastal floodplains. However, due to the process used in constructing these
data sets, there were many areas throughout the state in which floodplains
were not digitized. The primary purpose of this task was to complete the

Lake Erie Watershed LiDAR 2015 - hydro breaklines,2017,The Pennsylvania State University,"Lake Erie Watershed 2015 Ortho/LiDAR/Hydro Project will consist the following: • New project – wide 1”=100’ scale color digital orthoimagery (with a 6-inch pixel resolution) • New project wide 0.7-meter LiDAR (average point density) • New project wide hydrology • Crest Delineation This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 512 square miles of the Lake Erie Shoreline, PA. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 2.5' pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format.

Wetland sites, comprising more than 168,000 polygons, were defined as 1-km radius landscape circles around the center point of each wetland polygon. Landscape composition was summarized by extracting information of a set of patches of the same type (i.e., a NLCD land use class) within each circle. The following NLCD land use classes were studied: (1) water, (2) developed, open space, (3) developed, low intensity, (4) developed, medium intensity, (5) developed, high intensity, (6) barren, rock/clay/sand, (7) forest, (8) shrub, scrub, (9) pasture, hay, (10) cultivated crops, and (11) wetlands.

The result of the process is an image layer of cluster numbers with an accompanying table of band means by cluster number.
Color rendition:  the shade set is LANDSCOP Portrayal (landscape directed spectral composite portrayal).  Total of the visible bands is blue, total of the infrared bands is green, total of all bands modified to help distinguish conifers is red.
The images have been converted to ArcInfo Grid coverages, exported and transferred to compact disk.

"PAMAP Program Land Cover for Pennsylvania, 2005",2007,The Pennsylvania State University,"The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of
interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources.
The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data
are representative of the time period 2003-2007.

The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the 
more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value.
Further the coding is hierarchical so that each group can be related to other
codes within a general category.  For example, in the Anderson system the general 
classification of forest is a 4, a deciduous forest is 41, and so on.  For a 
description of the Anderson system see;

Pennsylvania Geomorphon Landform Maps 2021,2021,The Pennsylvania State University,"Geomorphons (geomorphologic phonotypes) are landforms computed from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition and the concept of computer line of sight (Jasiewicz and Stepinski 2013). The geomorphon algorithm was executed using an open source package, r.geomorphon, under the GRASS GIS environment. The final product includes 10 most common landforms: flat (FL - 1), peak (PK- 2), ridge (RI - 3), shoulder (SH - 4), spur (SP - 5), slope (SL -6), hollow (HL - 7), footslope (FS - 8), valley (VL - 9), and pit (PT - 10). The county level 3-m LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) DEM produced by the PAMAP Program was used for geomorphon calculations. This dataset consists of two sets of geomorphon maps for all 67 counties of Pennsylvania. The first set of maps are geomorphons calculated using the default parameters (i.e. OR = 200 m, IR = 20 m, FT = 1, and FD = 0) adapted from the Chesapeake Conservancy (Baker et al. 2018). The second set of maps are geomorphons calculated using a dynamic zone-parameterization system (i.e. OR = ORzone, IR = 20 m, FT = 1, and FD = 0) based on zones and the average-valley-width (AVW) at drainage area of 26 km2 of each county. The ORs are 200m, 2*AVW, and 4*AVW for zones of headwater, large-valley, and extra-large-valley, respectively.

PSU DEP Topographic Wetness Index (TWI),2020,The Pennsylvania State University,"GIS raster datasets displaying Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) for Pennsylvania by County. TWI raster datasets were derived from 2006-2008 LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) elevation points produced by the PAMAP Program. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum: NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. Raster spatial resolution is 9.6 ft (approximately 3 m).
The TWI, also called Compound Topographic Index (CTI) or Topographic Convergence Index (TCI), is a hydrological-based topographic index that describes the tendency of a cell or area to accumulate and retain water under steady-state conditions. TWI is defined as Ln(Contributing Area/Slope angle). It balances contributing areas capturing the tendency to receive water versus slope angles capturing the tendency to evacuate water. An automated procedure was developed in ArcMap® for the TWI computation. Contributing areas (i.e. cumulative contributing area per unit contour length) were determined based on the D-Infinity model proposed by Tarboton, D. (1997). Lengths were measured considering cell size and whether the direction is adjacent or diagonal. Land surface slope was computed using the Horn’s method.

Riparia Land Cover - Reclassed to facilitate habitat condition and water quality analyses 2005,2018,The Pennsylvania State University,"Many land cover interpretations strive for an Anderson Level 2 (Anderson et al., 1976) classification.  The important distinction splits Anderson Level 1 cover types such as Forest and Agriculture into more specific cover types such as Deciduous or Coniferous Forest and Row Crops or Pasture.  These divisions provide more information when a modeling effort studies wildlife that favor specific forest types (Mahan et al., 2010) and agricultural models to predict watershed condition (Brooks et al., 2002).  While this level of detail is beneficial in these instances many studies seek to model ecological condition where too much detail can become challenging to understand.  When ecological condition is the goal detailed classifications can produce confusing results, thus, it is common practice to reclassify the original land cover to better target a specified project goal.

"2015 Cartographic Boundary File, State-County-Census Tract for Pennsylvania, 1:500,000",2015,U S Census Bureau,"he 2015 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=cb_2015_42_tract_500k.xml

"Delaware Cropland Data Layer (CDL) - raster 1:100,000",2002,U S Department of Agriculture,"The USDA-NASS 2002 Delaware Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Delaware

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis.

"Maryland Cropland Data Layer (CDL) - raster 1:100,000",2002,U S Department of Agriculture,"The USDA-NASS 2002 Maryland Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Maryland

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis.

The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files. The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of New Jersey

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Pennsylvania.

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997).

EPA Map of Radon Zones for Pennsylvania,2021,U S Environmental Protection Agency,"The purpose of this map is to assist national, state and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.

The Map of Radon Zones was developed in 1993 to identify areas of the U.S. with the potential for elevated indoor radon levels. The map is intended to help governments and other organizations target risk reduction activities and resources. The Map of Radon Zones should not be used to determine if individual homes need to be tested. No matter where you live, test your home for radonâ€”itâ€™s easy and inexpensive. Fix your home if your radon level is 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) or higher. Consider fixing if your level is between 2 and 4 pCi/L.

The Map of Radon Zones was developed using data on indoor radon measurements, geology, aerial radioactivity, soil parameters, and foundation types.

National Wetlands Inventory for Pennsylvania - line,2005,U S Fish and Wildlife Service,"NWI digital data files are records of wetlands location and
classification as developed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
The classification system was adopted as a national
classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data
Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5
minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric
coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and
wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide
coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii,
Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean.
Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI
maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from
aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to
scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors.
Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily
photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In
general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and
white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative,
with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet
meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared
photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this
photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland
identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps
therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this
mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other
information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department
of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that

Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976).  The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties.  

The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed.  MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer.  MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values.  MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. 

Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation.  For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture).  Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture.  

The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=CBWLCD_1984.xml

Delaware River Basin Catchments Based on Strahler Stream Order 1 Determined from a 900-cell Flow Accumulation Raster in Areas Not Covered by NHD Catchments for 8-digit HUC,2016,U S Geological Survey,"In 2012, catchments were generated in the Delaware River Basin for 8-digit HUCs in the areas underlain by the Marcellus Shale (all of 02040101, 02040102, 02040103, 02040104; and headwater areas of 02040106 and 02040203) based on the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Strahler first- and second-order streams. There were areas that did not have a catchment generated so another methodology needed to be used in an attempt to fill in the 'gap areas'. A 900-cell, flow accumulation raster generated for the Pennsylvania StreamStats application was used as a surrogate stream layer with the same Strahler ordering system applied to help fill in the 'gap areas'. Points were manually placed at the downstream end of the Strahler Order 1 and 2 reaches using the surrogate streams as a guide. This manual point placement is different from the automated method used to develop the catchments generated from the NHD flowlines. The manual placement of the catchment pour points does not include a point downstream of a confluence, therefore, not as many catchments are generated in the 'gap-area' processing.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=DRBC_Catchments_MPG.xml

The Assessment Unit is defined within the context of the higher-level Total Petroleum System.  The Assessment Unit is shown here as a geographic boundary interpreted, defined, and mapped by the geologist responsible for the province and incorporates a set of known or postulated oil and (or) gas accumulations sharing similar geologic, geographic, and temporal properties within the Total Petroleum System, such as source rock, timing, migration pathways, trapping mechanism, and hydrocarbon type.  The Assessment Unit boundary is defined geologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the Assessment Unit, such as limits of reservoir rock, geologic structures, source rock, and seal lithologies.  The only exceptions to this are Assessment Units that border the Federal-State water boundary.  In these cases, the Federal-State water boundary forms part of the Assessment Unit boundary.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=NAOGP_DevonianSiltstoneShaleAssessmentUnit.xml

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived first- and second-order catchments for HUC  02040104,2017,U S Geological Survey,"A breakthrough in water resources management occurred in 1961 when President Kennedy and the governors of Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York for the first time signed concurrent compact legislation into law creating a regional body with the force of law to oversee a unified approach to managing a river system without regard to political boundaries. The members of this regional body - the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) - include the four basin state governors and the Division Engineer, North Atlantic Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who serves as the federal representative. Commission programs include water quality protection, water supply allocation, regulatory review (permitting), water conservation initiatives, watershed planning, drought management, flood loss reduction, and recreation. Much of the new drilling interest taking place in northeastern Pennsylvania and southern New York is targeted at reaching the natural gas found in the Marcellus Shale formation, which underlies about 36 percent of the Delaware River Basin. Because the Marcellus Shale is considered a tight geologic formation, natural gas deposits were not previously thought to be practically and economically mineable using traditional techniques. New horizontal drilling and extraction methods, coupled with higher energy costs, have given energy companies reason to take a new interest in mining the natural gas deposits within the Marcellus Shale. In connection with natural gas drilling, the commission has identified three major areas of concern: 1.Gas drilling projects in the Marcellus Shale or other formations may have a substantial effect on the water resources of the basin by reducing the flow in streams and/or aquifers used to supply the significant amounts of fresh water needed in the natural gas mining process. 2.On-site drilling operations may potentially add, discharge or cause the release of pollutants into the ground water or surface water. 3.The recovered ""frac water"" must be treated and disposed of properly.

Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).The geographic extent of
the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quad plus The overedge
ranges a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters
beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner
points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal
matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83
and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation
of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each
line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to
east with the order of the lines from north to south.

four ASCII header records, followed by a series of 8-bit
binary image data records. The radiometric image
brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels ranging
from 0 to 255. The metadata embedded in the digital
orthophoto contain a wide range of descriptive
information including format source information,
production instrumentation and dates, and data to assist
with displaying and georeferencing the image. 
DOQ images are acquired as a part of the USGS' National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP).

National Elevation Dataset 10 Meter 7.5x7.5 minute quadrangle for Pennsylvania,1999,U S Geological Survey,"The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation Database (NED).The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to a consistent datum, edge-match, fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams, recast the data to a consistent geographic projection and convert all elevation values to decimal meters as a consistent unit of measure.

NED has a resolution of one-third arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for much of the conterminous United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico in a NAD83 datum. There is a resolution of two arc-seconds for Alaska and the datum is NAD27.

NED at 10 meters is created using the same methods outlined above with the source data being mostly the 10m DEMs. DEMs at 5 meters, 1/3 arc-second, and 1/9 arc-second maps are also used where available. In some cases, the 10m NED is resampled from LIDAR or created using aerial photography.

One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. Artifact removal greatly improves the quality of the slope, shaded-relief, and synthetic drainage information that can be derived from the elevation data.  Geospatial elevation data are used by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping, and visualization applications.

NRCS has elected to ONLY serve NED 10 which is 10 meter or better and not NED 10 which was resampled from 30 meter. NRCS also serves the maps in a UTM projection.

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=panhdareahires.xml

National Land Cover Dataset 1992 - Pennsylvania; Albers GeoTIFF,1999,U S Geological Survey,"These data can be used in a geographic information system (GIS) for any
number of purposes such as assessing wildlife habitat, water quality,
pesticide runoff, land use change, etc.  The State data sets are provided
with a 300 meter buffer beyond the State border to facilitate combining
the State files into larger regions.

The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled
and the resulting limitations of these data.  The National Land Cover Dataset
was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial
resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where
available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was
conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18
Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for
'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a
spatially-broad perspective.  Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below)
correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states.  Thus,
the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The
statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region.

Important Caution Advisory

With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to
see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the
dataset for larger-scale or local analyses.  This evaluation must be made
remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC.  NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation.  The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014).  
For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products:  
1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover
2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class
3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness
4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels
5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center.  
In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change.  All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products were revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  
NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail).  All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.

NLCD 2016 Land Cover Conterminous United States,2019,U S Geological Survey,"The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released four
National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011.
These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover
change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s
land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016
design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land
cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was
conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing
Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development
and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land
cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for
generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and
an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed
strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous
U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was
achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive
and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.
Questions about the NLCD 2016 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2016 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov. See included spatial metadata for more details.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=NLCD_2016_Land_Cover_L48.xml

For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover; 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness; 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels; and 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center. In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 products can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=nlcd_2011_USFS_tree_canopy_2011_edition_2014_03_31.xml

"Topographic Change - in Philadelphia, During the Last Century",2000,U S Geological Survey,"A scope of work was developed in response to a request by the U. S. Army Corps
of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The request was to perform a topographic
change grid analysis for the Frankford 7.5-minute quadrangle, 1:24,000-scale
topographic map, which includes the Wissinoming neighborhood, and the Germantown 7.5-minute quadrangle, which includes the Logan and Feltonville neighborhoods of the City of Philadelphia. The following tasks were performed under this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in elevation between the modern and historic surveys. Prior to release, the fully documented GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was reviewed for (1) com-pleteness of documentation and for (2) appropriate analysis and discussion of uncertainties.

PDF (Portable Document Format) digital files are now available for US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen.

The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file.

GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar.

PDF (Portable Document Format) digital files are now available for US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen.

The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file.

GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar.

"USGS NED Luzerne County, PA 2019 - breaklines",2019,U S Geological Survey,"Breakline data is used to hydroflatten the DEMs created for the WVSA, PA 2017 Lidar project project. Breaklines are reviewed against lidar intensity imagery to verify completeness of capture. The compilation procedure included use of lidar intensity, bare earth surface model, point cloud data, and open source imagery in an effort to manually compile hydrologic features in a 2-d environment. Following the compilation phase, a separate process was used to adjust the breakline data to best match the water level at the time of the lidar collection. Any ponds and/or lakes were adjusted to be at or just below the bank and to be at a constant elevation. Any streams were adjusted to be at or just below the bank and to be monotonic. Manual QAQC and peer-based QC review was performed on all delineated data to ensure horizontal placement quality and on all adjusted data to ensure vertical placement quality. Bridge breaklines were also compiled in efforts to generate an accurate DEM product. The final hydrologic and bridge breakline product was delivered in ESRI geodatabase format and was also used in the processing of the DEM deliverableGeographic Extent: This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over an AOI surrounding Wilkes-Barre, PA (+/- 401.5 square miles) Dataset Description: WVSA, PA – 2017 Impervious Surface project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meter.

The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD 1983 (2011), UTM Zone 18, meters and vertical datum of NAVD 1988 (GEOID 12B), meters. LiDAR data were delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files formatted to 7,975 individual 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter tiles, as tiled intensity imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter schema. Continuous breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in fall 2017, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 150 ground control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 245 independent accuracy checkpoints, 142 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (142 NVA points), 103 in Tall Weeds categories (103 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=USGS_LiDAR2017.xml

Zebra Mussel Distribution,2008,U S Geological Survey,"The concern caused by the explosive spread of the zebra mussel, (Dreissena
        polymorpha), within the United States resulted in passage of the
        Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (P.L.
        101-646).  The impact of this biofouling pest on the economy and
        ecological processes in the U.S. and Canada has required prompt action on
        a large scale to prevent further infestations and minimize ecological
        degradation.  This map layer is a compilation of reports of confirmed
        zebra mussel sightings in the United States from 1988 to January 2008.
        It provides geographical and historical information to show distribution
        over time.  The reports came from a variety of Federal, State, and
        municipal agencies, public utilities, universities, engineering and
        private consultant firms.  The locations of confirmed sightings were
        registered at 1:100,000-scale on EPA Reach File Version 3.0 and are
        maintained as an ArcInfo export file.  This is a revised version of the
        June 2005 map layer.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=ZebraMusselDistribution2008.xml

"Flood Inundation Mapping for Susquehanna River in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania - 11-ft to 37-ft",2013,United States Army Corps of Engineers  USACE,"This layer was created as part of a Flood Inundation Map Library developed for display within the NOAA National Weather Service's Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services (AHPS), the SRBC Susquehanna Inundation Map Viewer (SIMV), and the USGS Flood Inundation Mapper (FIM). This data represents the potential flood extent for a stage of 11-ft to 37-ft as recorded at the Harrisburg (Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, PA; USGS ID 01570500) river gage. This data is part of a series of inundation layers meant to correlate observations and forecasts from the river gage with a visual representation of the areas impacted by high water. The data set of flood inundation areas was created from flood scenarios generated by HEC-RAS runs provided by USACE-Baltimore and LiDAR data from PASDA processed to extract bare earth points. A shapefile of inundation area for each stage was created and subsequently merged to form continuous datasets for the main-stem Susquehanna River and backwater areas on its tributaries.This data was developed to assist the public and emergency officials with planning and response to high water episodes at or near a defined National Weather Service river forecast point.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=USACE_DepthGrid_HarrisburgFloodInundation.xml

Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=ForestPatch_2011_DRBC.xml

Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:3000 and all observable errors were corrected.This dataset was developed to support land-cover mapping and modeling initiatives in the Delaware River Basin. At the time of its publication, it represented the most accurate and detailed land cover map for the New Jersey portion of the Delaware River Basin.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=landcover_2013_newjersey_delawareriverbasin.xml

"Landcover - Tree Canopy Change, Washington DC, 2006 - 2011",2013,University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory,"Change in the District of Columbia’s tree canopy estimated from 2011 leaf-on imagery and 2006 leaf-on imagery in conjunction with 2008 leaf-off LiDAR. This layer consists of three classes of tree canopy: 1) no change, 2) loss, and 3) gain. No change indicates that the tree canopy has not changed substantially from 2006 to 2011. Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Extensive quality assurance and quality control methods were employed.

Important selection criteria for Natural Heritage Areas are the existence of habitat for plants and animals of special concern, the existence of uncommon or especially important natural communities, and the size and landscape context of a site containing good quality natural features. Large areas and areas that are minimally disturbed by development provide the backbone that links habitats and allows plants and animals to shift and move across sizable portions of the landscape. The polygons in this layer represent two types of conservation areas. A Biological Diversity Area (BDA) is defined as an area containing plants or animals of special concern at state or federal levels, exemplary natural communities, or exceptional native diversity.
