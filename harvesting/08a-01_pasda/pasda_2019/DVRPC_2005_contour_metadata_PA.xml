      <attraccr>The accuracy of the ground control is confirmed by the evaluation of the results of the analytical bundle adjustment.  The residuals of the final adjustment ensured compliance with NSSDA standards.  The Pre Adjustment Gross Error Detection Statistical Test (Data Snooping, with a confidence level of 99.9%) has been applied to all observations included in the aerial triangulations. To detect small gross errors, during Adjustment Robust Estimators were used with the same confidence level and a power of the test of 1-beta=0.2. Systematic errors were eliminated through self calibration and through Additional Parameters. Their numerical stability, statistical significance, internal and external reliability were checked using Student-t test with the same confidence level and Variance/Co-variance analysis. Finally, the arrived variance factor was submitted to a Chi-square test against the pre-adjustment variance factor using a confidence level 99.9%.  Evaluation of the DEM includes checking the terrain data for spikes and wells, omissions, and other anomalies that do not meet the project accuracy requirements.  The horizontal and vertical accuracy has been tested by comparing the coordinates of well-defined points in the dataset with coordinates of the same points from an independent source of higher accuracy.</attraccr>

    <logic>All files are inspected by the Production Manager to ensure that they conform to the specified file naming conventions, all files load in their correct geographic position, all files conform to the project specifications.  The data has been checked for duplicate features, correct edge matching, overshoots, undershoots, offsets, overall cartographic appearance.</logic>

        <horizpar>The horizontal accuracy standard follows the NSSDA-1998 standard.  The maximum permissible RMSE for 95% of the horizontal check points for the mapping product is 5 feet or better.</horizpar>

Existing "Contour Grade DEMs" were available from previous Chester County and City of Philadelphia projects.  These DEMs were reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect the terrain conditions of the new 2005 imagery to insure that the resulting contours meet NMAS for 1"=200', 5' CI mapping.</procdesc>
