      <attraccr>During photographic reproduction of the source photographs, limited analog dodging (radiometric editing) is performed to improve image quality. Analog dodging consists of holding back light from certain areas of the sensitized photographic material to avoid overexposure. The diapositive is inspected to ensure clarity and radiometric uniformity. Diapositive image brightness values are collected with a minimum of image quality manipulation. Image brightness values may deviate from the brightness values of the original images because of image value interpolation during the scanning and rectification processes. Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto with the original unrectified image to determine if the digital orthophoto has the same or better image quality as the original unrectified input image. Slight systematic radiometric differences can be detected between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source photograph capture dates and sun angles along flight lines when the aerial photographs were taken. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr>

        <horizpar>Compliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data.  The elevation data were generated by autocorrelation and manual processes.  An RMS value for each tile was calculated based on the photos utilized in the production of the tile by comparing the AT X and Y coordinates.  This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in U.S. Survey Feet.</horizpar>

          <horizpav>.324 survey feet</horizpav>
          <horizpae>The horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the accuracy of the aerotriangulation and digital elevation model (DEM).  The DEM accuracy assessment was achieved by comparing the aerotriangulation-derived elevation with the elevation of the DEM at the same X and Y coordinates.  In addition, visual examination was employed to assess all tiles and its relative edge match.  All results were examined for consistency and its compliance with the NSSDA accuracy standard.</horizpae>

Source photography:  natural color stable base.  Control: airborne GPS supplemented with photo identifiable field control. Scanning:  Z/I Imaging PhotoScan flatbed metric scanner.  Aerotriangulation:  Photo-T.  Elevation Model:  autocorrelation and manual collection.  Radiometric Balancing:  Proprietary and COTS Software (PhotoShop). Orthorectification:  Z/I Ortho Pro 4.0 software package.  Mosaic:  Z/I Ortho Pro 4.0 software package.  Processed on Windows NT/2000 systems.

The ground control and airborne GPS data was integrated into a rigid network through the completion of a fully analytical aerotriangulation adjustment.  The original aerial film was scanned at a resolution of 21 microns.  The scans were produced using Z/I Imaging PhotoScan flatbed metric scanners.  The scanned images were then used as input, along with ground control, airborne GPS data and camera calibration data into a Z/I Imaging softcopy system for final adjustment.  

The digital orthophotography was produced in natural color at an ortho scale of 1:2400 with a 2- foot pixel resolution.  A step-by-step breakdown of the digital orthophoto production process follows.  
1.  A representative number of raster image files were visually checked for image quality on the workstation.  
2.  The digital image files were oriented on the digital orthophoto production workstation.  The following information was then loaded onto the workstation.  - The camera calibration parameters and flight line direction. - ground control and pass point locations. - The exterior orientation parameters from the aerotriangulation process. - ASCII file containing the corner coordinates of the orthophotos. - The digital elevation model in a DGN format. - Project-specific requirements such as final sheet size and resolution. - Orientation parameters developed from the aerotriangulation solution.  
3.  A coordinate transformation based on the camera calibration fiducial coordinates was then undertaken.  This transformation allowed the conversion of every measured element of the plates to a sample/line location.  Each pixel in an image was then referenced by sample and line (its horizontal and vertical position) and matched to project control.  The newly rectified image was visually checked for pixel drop-out and/or other artifacts that may degrade the final orthophoto image.  
4. DTM data was imported and written to the correct subdirectory on disk.  The final digital orthophotos were referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinates, South Zone, NAD83, Survey Foot. 
5. The DTM file was reinspected for missing or erroneous data points.  
6.  A complete differential rectification was carried out using an exponential algorithm that removed image displacement due to topographic relief, tip and tilt of the aircraft at the moment of exposure, and radial distortion within the camera.  Each final orthophoto was produced at a scale of 1/200 with a 1-foot pixel resolution.  
7.  Each digital orthophoto image was visually checked for accuracy on the workstation screen.  The digital orthophotos were then edge-matched using a module of the Ortho Pro software package.  
8.  Once the orthophotos were inspected and approved for accuracy, the files were copied to the network and downloaded by the orthophoto finishing department.  This production unit was responsible for radiometrically correcting the orthophotos prior to completing the mosaicking and clipping of the final tiles.  
9.  The processed images were mosaicked using the Ortho Pro software.  File names were assigned.  
10.  The finishing department performed final visual checks for orthophoto image quality.  The images were inspected using Adobe Photoshop, which enabled the technician to remove dust and lint from the image files interactively. 
11.  The final orthophoto images were written out into compressed MrSID format, using 10:1 compression, untiled, Arc/Info readable, GeoTIFF format.
