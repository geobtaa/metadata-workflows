Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.dAll GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived. This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements. Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. Seamline mismatches are corrected unless the overall displacement is less than one pixel.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free.fPlease see the Accuracy Analyst report for a detailed report showing the 14 control points measured to produce the NSSDA value of 0.199 meters (0.652 feet). This meets the required value of 0.38 meters (1.247 feet). 0.199NSSDA in meters.iThere is no vertical component for orthophotos.  aAllentownPA_Orthos2016.  aWindows 7 OS; Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, Internet Explorer, and Access); MicroStation version 8; Intergraph suite of products; Esri ArcGIS 10; UltraEdit; Global Mapper; GeoExpress 9.  aNone.  pU.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1996, Standards for Digital Orthophotos: Reston, VA. 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Category 7aimage map.2ISO 19115 Category 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Category 7anatural color orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Category 7arectified photograph.2ISO 19115 Category 7a7.5 centimeter orthoimage.2ISO 19115 Category 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Category 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Category 7aUS.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aUS.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aUnited States.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aUS.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPennsylvania.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPA.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aLehigh County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aAllentown.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
