Data are accurate to the best of originator's knowledge. Data compilation and checking were done manually; there is a possibility that some errors remain. Mexican data were collected to different standards, therefore the distributions shown for Mexico are not as accurate as for the U.S. or Canada.dNo tests for logical consistency were performed on these data. The data used to create this file were collected over a 100-150 year period. No attempt has been made to separate historical from current distributions. A positive record does not necessarily imply current residence of the species. Records may represent either resident, migratory, or stray status. Not all areas have been surveyed or reported on as completely as others, so there remain gaps in the data used to compile the original occurrence file. As more fieldwork is completed and reported upon by researchers in these sparsely-known and sparsely-reported areas, future updates of this map layer should improve in these areas.eThis map layer contains information on bat distribution for the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and the 13 Canadian provinces and territories. No data were collected on bats of Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands. Species distributions within Mexico are shown only for bats which also occur in the United States.fDue to the variety of sources used, there was varying accuracy in the way bat records were reported. Some of the reports were as latitude and longitude, UTM, or public land survey system coordinates. Some locations were given as a number of miles in a direction from a nearby town or landmark. Others were reported as just a mountain, park, or waterway. Each location was digitized to the nearest hundredth of a geographic degree as a single point based on the best description provided. If no specific location was reported more accurately than county level, the point was digitized to the center of the county, rounded to the nearest twentieth of a degree of longitude and latitude.  aatlasftp-html_openChapters=chpbio%23chpbio&gt;-175fa361-1bee-11e8-b3f0-1866da3917eb___unknown.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535.  cCommon_namdThe common name of the bat species., National Atlas of the United States 7abiota.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aMyotis sodalis.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aIndiana Myotis.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aBiology.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aZoology.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aMammals.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aBats.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aDistribution.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aBiogeography.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aZoogeography.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aRanges.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 0aNorth America. 0aMid-Atlantic.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html?openChapters=chpbio#chpbio40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.batcon.org/home/default.asp
