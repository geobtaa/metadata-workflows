Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.d"GeoTIFFs conform to the specifications set forth by the USGS for production of orthophotos in the Task Order Number G12PD00343." Logical consistency is implicit in the raster image data structure. Source imagery is cloud free.e"Orthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free."f"The 0.30 meter ortho image horizontal accuracy does not exceed 1.52-meters NSSDA 95% confidence (0.88-meters Root Mean Squared (RMSE) Error XY (0.62 meter RMSE X or Y)." The relative accuracy is assembled by comparing rectified images generated from adjacent strips of imagery. The absolute accuracy is assessed by measuring the ground control points in the rectified image against the actual surveyed co-ordinate position. The testing is for overall accuracy. This data has been produced to be fully compliant with the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for mapping at this scale.0.58The horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the quality of the DEM. The elevation data was provided by the PAMAP website. Airborne GPS/IMU data was used. All photo identifiable checkpoints were measured and compared to the surveyed checkpoints to determine the RMSE. All rectified chip overlap was checked for mismatch. All final tiles were checked visually for edge matching.i"The vertical accuracy of the airborne GPS control was tested through the aerotriangulation and vertical positions were adjusted to best fit the GPS ground control in the final aerotriangulation."j0.059kThe vertical accuracy of the airborne GPS control does not exceed the 0.3 meter requirement.  aNGA_USGS_Pittsburgh2012.  a"Intergraph OrthoPro ver 6.01, IRAS C ver 10.0, Photoshop ver CS5, Windows XP and Windows 7, INPHO OrthoVista 4.6, Global Mapper 13, Bentley MicroStation 7 and 8" Microsoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.1850.  aNone.  pU.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1999, Standards for Digital Orthoimagery: Reston, VA 0adigital spatial data. 0a0.3 meter orthoimage. 0arectified image. 0aorthophoto. 0anatural color orthophoto. 0aorthoimage. 0aimage map. 0aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover. 0a010. 0aNational Standards for Spatial Digital Accuracy (NSSDA) 7aUnited States.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology 7aU.S.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology 7aUS.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology 7aPA.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology 7aAllegheny County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology 7aPittsburgh.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology 7aPennsylvania.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://gisdata.usgs.gov/tdds/downloadfile.php?TYPE=ortho&ORIG=META&FNAME=17TNE745685_201203_0x3000m_CL_1.zip40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html
