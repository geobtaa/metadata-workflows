The RGB values for a particular color, therefore, will remain consistent throughout that DRG series. Although the color values of the DRG may sometimes match those of the paper source map, a user will usually notice small differences between the colors on the digital image and on the paper map. Also, the quality of the user's monitor affects the DRG color displayed. Although the DRG generally contains the complete content of the source map, features may occasionally be blurred because of substandard source materials. The DRG also may contain misclassified pixels (color noise). The DRG is an 8-bit color image that employs a color palette to ensure uniform colors throughout a particular DRG series. All DRG's within a series must have the same RGB value.dThe USGS DRG is produced with the intention of replicating as close as possible the original source map. Users of the DRG will note, however, that a certain amount of "noise" can be discerned when small areas are blown up or viewed under zoomed-in conditions. This noise is in the form of random specks or pixels of color and halos due to any number of factors, such as, the quality of the source, the use of screens and patterns on the litho, and the unevenness of ink due to saturation and absorption. Discontinuities or breaks in linear features may also be present and are due to improper calibration or usage of the scanner, the condition of the source, and resampling. Descreening, quantizing, and noise filtering are methods used to reduce noise, which, besides creating a more aesthetically pleasing image, have the added benefit of reducing the size of the image file. Removal of lithographic screen patterns is preferred but not required.eImage completeness is checked by visually inspecting a sampling of DRG's. Each selected DRG will be examined for gaps (missing data) in the main body of the map, the map collar, the overedge areas, and any insetsfDRG's will retain the horizontal accuracy of the source maps. Most USGS printed maps contain the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) note in the collar area. The NMAS states that for maps on publication scales of 1:20,000 or smaller, not more than 10 percent of the points tested shall be in error by more than 1/50 inch measured on the publication scale. Test points must be "well-defined", that is, easily visible or recoverable on the ground. For DRG's this accuracy statement applies only to that area of the DRG that falls within the neatline of the source map (excluding inset areas). Overedge areas falling outside the transformation boundary area (the map neatline), can exhibit anomalies or discrepancies. These anomalies also will appear in the map inset areas and in the map collar. For maps without the NMAS note, the horizontal accuracy is unknown. However, the DRG will retain the accuracy of the source map.  adrg24kcropped.  pStandards for Digital Raster Graphic 7adigital raster graphic.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adrg.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic quadrangle.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7araster image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aPennsylvania.2none40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
