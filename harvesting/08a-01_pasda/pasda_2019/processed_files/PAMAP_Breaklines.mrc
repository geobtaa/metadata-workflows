The residuals of the final adjustment ensured compliance with NSSDA standards. The Pre Adjustment Gross Error Detection Statistical Test (Data Snooping, with a confidence level of 99.9%) have been applied to all observations included in the aerial triangulations. To detect small gross errors, during Adjustment Robust Estimators were used with the same confidence level and a power of the test of 1-beta=0.2. Systematic errors were eliminated through self calibration and through Additional Parameters. Their numerical stability, statistical significance, internal and external reliability were checked using Student-t test with the same confidence level and Variance/Co-variance analysis. Finally, the arrived variance factor C was submitted to a Chi-square test against the pre-adjustment variance factor using a confidence level 99.9%. During the scanning of the original aerial film, the image histogram for each frame is carefully examined to ensure that the image has been scanned so that the minimum and maximum brightness values are captured to eliminate any loss of detail due to saturation of dark or light areas. The LiDAR flying height, field of view, laser repetition rate, aircraft speed, and the maximum baseline distances from the aerial platform to the ground based GPS stations have been fine tuned to ensure an RMSEz of the processed data at the 18.5 cm level for the base earth surface as required by the FEMA guidelines. See the PAMAP Technical Proposal dated January 11, 2006 for further QA/QC procedures.dAll files are inspected by the Production Manager to ensure that they conform to the specified file naming conventions, all files load in their correct geographic position, all files conform to the project specifications for file standard and content.eAll files are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or misplacement exists in the data. The files have been checked to ensure that the boundary and the content has been covered in its entirety.fThe horizontal accuracy standard follows the NSSDA-1998 standard. The maximum permissible RMSE for 95% of the horizontal check points for the mapping product is 5 feet or better.iThe vertical accuracy will meet the requirements of NSSDA at the 95% confidence interval (1.96 x RMSE).  aPAMAP_Breaklines.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.5.1450.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRIpWhere applicable, all data conforms to the PAMAP Technical Proposal dated January 11, 2006. 7aDEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7acontours.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aLiDAR.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7abreaklines.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPennsylvania.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
