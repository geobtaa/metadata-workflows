The residuals of the final adjustment ensured compliance with NSSDA standards. The Pre Adjustment Gross Error Detection Statistical Test (Data Snooping, with a confidence level of 99.9%) has been applied to all observations included in the aerial triangulations. To detect small gross errors, during Adjustment Robust Estimators were used with the same confidence level and a power of the test of 1-beta=0.2. Systematic errors were eliminated through self calibration and through Additional Parameters. Their numerical stability, statistical significance, internal and external reliability were checked using Student-t test with the same confidence level and Variance/Co-variance analysis. Finally, the arrived variance factor was submitted to a Chi-square test against the pre-adjustment variance factor using a confidence level 99.9%. Evaluation of the DEM includes checking the terrain data for spikes and wells, omissions, and other anomalies that do not meet the project accuracy requirements. The horizontal and vertical accuracy has been tested by comparing the coordinates of well-defined points in the dataset with coordinates of the same points from an independent source of higher accuracy. The program ORTHOQC is able to match the original image pixels of pass/tie points, ground control points, and check points with the final ortho, extract the corresponding horizontal coordinates from the digital ortho and compare them with the original measured points in the field or adjusted from the aerotriangulation. Values of statistics such as RMSE, Max and Min Discrepancies, standard deviation, etc. are then derived and analyzed statistically.dAll files are inspected by the Production Manager to ensure that they conform to the specified file naming conventions, all files load in their correct geographic position when loaded using the ASCII file header, all files conform to the project specifications for pixel resolution, file standard, dimensions, and compression, and all files do not contain blemishes such as visible seam lines, tone differences, data dropout or artifacts; scan swathing, or warped bridges and overpasses.eAll imagery is visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacement exists in the image area. Imagery is mosaicked to ensure complete coverage for map sheets. The imagery has been checked to ensure that the boundary and the content has been covered in its entirety.fThe horizontal accuracy standard follows the NSSDA-1998 standard. The maximum permissible RMSE for 95% of the horizontal check points for the mapping product is 5 feet or better.iThe DEM data meets the required vertical accuracy necessary to ensure that the horizontal accuracies of the orthophotos are met.  aDVRPC2010.  pWhere applicable, all data conforms to the Proposal for 2005 Aerial Photography Project presented to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission August 5, 2004. 7aorthoimagery.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophotography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial photography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophotograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial photograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial photo.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital orthoimagery.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital aerial photo.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified photograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimagery.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aortho.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDTM/DEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aDVRPC Region. 0aBucks County. 0aChester County. 0aDelaware County. 0aMontgomery County. 0aPhiladelphia County. 0aPennsylvania. 0aBucks County. 0aChester County. 0aDelaware County. 0aMontgomery County. 0aPhiladelphia County.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.dvrpc.org/40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
