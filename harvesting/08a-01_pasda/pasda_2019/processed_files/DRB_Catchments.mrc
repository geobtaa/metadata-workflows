Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. Line segments are a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs. No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a data string. All nodes are represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or end of a line segment.e30-meter DEM, elevation data were used as the foundation to determine the first- and second-order catchments. Extraneous polygons were removed if they were determined to be artifacts from the GIS automated processing instead of true catchment areas related to the pour-point location.fThe horizontal accuracy standard follows the NSSDA-1998 standard. The maximum permissible RMSE for 95% of the horizontal check points for the mapping product is 5 feet or better.  aDRB_Catchments.  aArcGIS 9.3.1. 7astream order.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aStrahler.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7acatchment.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aInlandWaters.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aNew Jersey.2Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) 7aNew York.2Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) 7aDelware River Basin.2Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) 7aPennsylvania.2Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://pa.water.usgs.gov
