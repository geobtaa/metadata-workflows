The DRG uses a standard palette to ensure uniform color throughout a particular map series. The RGB values for a particular color, therefore, will remain consistent throughout that DRG series. Although the color values of the DRG may sometimes match those of the paper source map, a user will usually notice small differences between the colors on the digital image and on the paper map. Also, the quality of the user's monitor affects the DRG color displayed. Although the DRG generally contains the complete content of the source map, features may occasionally be blurred because of substandard source materials. The DRG also may contain misclassified pixels (color noise). 
													 The DRG is an 8-bit color image that employs a color palette to ensure uniform colors throughout a particular DRG series. All DRG's within a series must have the same RGB value.

    </attracc>
    <logic>The USGS DRG is produced with the intention of replicating as close as possible the original source map. Users of the DRG will note, however, that a certain amount of "noise" can be discerned when small areas are blown up or viewed under zoomed-in conditions. This noise is in the form of random specks or pixels of color and halos due to any number of factors, such as, the quality of the source, the use of screens and patterns on the litho, and the unevenness of ink due to saturation and absorption. Discontinuities or breaks in linear features may also be present and are due to improper calibration or usage of the scanner, the condition of the source, and resampling.  Descreening, quantizing, and noise filtering are methods used to reduce noise, which, besides creating a more aesthetically pleasing image, have the added benefit of reducing the size of the image file. Removal of lithographic screen patterns is preferred but not required.</logic>
    <complete>Image completeness is checked by visually inspecting a sampling of DRG's. Each selected DRG will be examined for gaps (missing data) in the main body of the map, the map collar, the overedge areas, and any insets </complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>DRG's will retain the horizontal accuracy of the source maps. Most USGS printed maps contain the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) note in the collar area. The NMAS states that for maps on publication scales of 1:20,000 or smaller, not more than 10 percent of the points tested shall be in error by more than 1/50 inch measured on the publication scale.  Test points must be "well-defined", that is, easily visible or recoverable on the ground. For DRG's this accuracy statement applies only to that area of the DRG that falls within the neatline of the source map (excluding inset areas). Overedge areas falling outside the transformation boundary area (the map neatline), can exhibit anomalies or discrepancies.  These anomalies also will appear in the map inset areas and in the map collar. For maps without the NMAS note, the horizontal accuracy is unknown. However, the DRG will retain the accuracy of the source map. </horizpa>
      <vertacc>In the DRG the vertical positional accuracy is referenced in the DRG collar.</vertacc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>
The production procedures, instrumentation, harware and software used in the 
collection of standard DRG products vary depending on systems used at the 
contract, cooperator, or the USGS production sites.  The majority of DRG data sets 
are acquired through government partnership and contract.  The process step 
describes, in general, the process used in the production of DRGs from 
1:250,000-scale maps.
1. Production of a DRG begins with the scanning of a paper
7.5-minute topographic map (map1) on a high-resolution scanner. Scanning 
resolutions range from 500-1,000 dpi with an output file of 160-300 Mb in size.
2. Removal of screens (descreening) and color quantization to reduce  the number 
of colors also takes place during the scanning phase.
3. The raw scan file is then transformed and georeferenced using UTM coordinates 
of the sixteen 2.5-minute grid ticks, which are obtained using the in-house 
produced program COORDAT and stored in a ground control file.  Those sixteen 
2.5-minute ticks are interactively visited and assigned their respective UTM 
coordinates. The USGS program XSHAPES4 then performs a piecewise linear rubber 
sheet transformation.
4. An output resolution of 2.4 meters (8.2 feet) is chosen to resample the file to 
250 dpi.
5.  The image file is converted to a TIFF 6.0 image and further reduced by 
converting the file to a run length encoded PackBits compression (type 32773).
6.  The color palette of the compressed DRG is then standardized by replacing the 
original RGB values assigned during the scanning process with standard RGB value 
combinations using the in-houseproduced TIFFREMAP program.
7. The DRG metadata file is completed.
8.  Prior to archiving the DRG undergoes the following quality  assurance 
procedures:
a. The color index values of each DRG are checked to ensure
the RGB combinations are consistent with the standardized
color palette.
b. All DRG files are inspected to ensure that they are
geometrically consistent with normal map presentation.
c. Selected DRG's are checked to ensure that data elements in
the DRG metadata file correspond to the map collar information
and to the information in the associated image file.
d. Selected DRG's are checked for georeferencing accuracy by
comparing the General Cartographic Transformation Package
(GCTP) calculated value of latitude and longitude tick marks
with corresponding tick intersections in the DRG image.
e. Transformations are checked on selected DRG's by comparing
the positions of well defined points, such as UTM grid
intersections in the graphic product, with the corresponding
image points in the DRG.
