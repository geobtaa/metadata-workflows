    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto.  Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>GeoTIFFs conform to the specifications set forth in the AeroMetric proposal.</logic>
    <complete>
      Orthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free.

        <procdesc>The digital images were aero-triangulated to support digital ortho image production for the Lancaster, PA project area.  Ground check point data was provided by AeroMetric, Inc.  The project was referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), UTM Zone 18 horizontally and to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) vertically.  Units were in meters.

 
The scale of the aerial photos was 1"=2116'.  The photography was exposed between 3/21/12 and 4/7/12.


Rectification was done using the aerotriangulation data, raw images, and PAMAP DEM data. All photo identifiable ground points were measured to verify the accuracy. These rectified images were used to generate seamlines which were then reviewed and edited. The rectified images were mosaicked, balanced, and cut into final image sheets.  The final sheets were viewed and artifacts were removed as well as other edits performed.  Final UTM sheets were then reprojected to PA-SPCS South Zone.  MrSID county mosaic was processed at 30:1 in MG3 format.</procdesc>
