Where there was a conflict, a note was included in the ACC_NOTES attribute field in each dataset. Be careful when summarizing areas and acreage and when depicting muliple protected lands layers at the same time.eWhile the Protected Lands Inventory enconpasses the majority of protected lands within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there are still significant gaps in the dataset. Only some land trusts and local government provided information on their parks and other protected properties. Some Federal and State acquisitions since 1998 are not reflected. The Nature Conservancy was able to provide data only fee simple acquisitions but not easements. Some environmentally sensitive lands were not included.fSpatial accuracy varies depending upon the source of the data, although every attempt was made to comply with National Map Accuracy Standards.  aPA_PLI_cntyageasements.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535.  cACC_NOTESdSpatial overlap., ESRI 7amanaged lands.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aconserved lands.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aprotected lands.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aagricultural lands.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aFarming.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
