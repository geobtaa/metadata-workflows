Denied permits originally drawn on the mylars in red cross hatch were sometimes mistaken for WPA mapped mines. This is particularly true in the north west part of the Bituminous coal field and the entire Anthracite field. There are NO WPA mapped mines in the Anthracite field.dPolygon topology present.eCoverage is believed to be complete for all areas with mining or permitting activities, with the following known exceptions: in Cool Spring quad B needs region built and in Reynoldsville quad Ca needs regions built.fWPA mapping from 1930's may be unreliable and coverages may appear distorted. These coverages are presented to give a reasonable guideline (+/-90) feet of what is on the ground in that area. No attempt was made to correlate coal seams when the quads were digitized. Some coverages for coal seams may appear where the coal seam does not exist. Care should be taken when these anomalies are discovered.  apa_bituminous2006.  pBMR 7ageology geo geologic geological.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7amining.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aminerals.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aBituminous.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aGeoscientific Information.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aAccident Quadrangle.2none40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
