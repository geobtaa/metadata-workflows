In addition, WAMS software (USFWS-NWI) tests the attributes against a master set of valid wetland attributes.dPolygons intersecting the neatline are closed along the border. Segments making up the outer and inner boundareies of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. Line segments are a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs. No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a data string. Intersecting lines are separated into individual line segments at the point of intersection. Point data are represented by two sets of coordinate pairs, each with the same coordinate values. All nodes are represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or end of a line segment. The neatline is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file. All data crossing the neatline are clipped to the neatline and data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Tests for logical consistency are performed by WAMS verification software (USFWS-NWI).eAll photo-interpretable wetlands are mapped. In the treeless prairies, 1/4 acre wetlands are mapped. In forested areas, small open water and emergent wetlands are mapped. In general, the minimum mapping units is from 1 to 3 acres depending on the wetland type and the scale and emulsion of the source aerial photography. In regions of the country where evergreen forested wetlands predominate, wetlands smaller than 3 acres may not be mapped. Thus, a detailed on-the ground and historical analysis of a single site may result in a revision of the wetland boundaries established through photographic interpretation. In addition, some small wetlands and those obscured by dense forest cover may not be included in this dataset. The NWI maps were originally created to represent wetlands throughout the United States. Allegheny County GIS then clipped the national map data to conform to the boundary of Allegheny County. The maps were also projected to GCS_North_American_1983, NAD_1983_StatePlane_Pennsylvania_South_FIPS_3702_Feet by Allegheny County GIS.fHorizontal positional accuracy for the digital data is tested by visual comparison of the source with hard copy plots.+/- 5 feet  aAlleghenyCounty_NWI2000.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.1.1332.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7aenvironment.2ISO 19115.3 Topic Categories 7ageoscientificInformation.2ISO 19115.3 Topic Categories 7ainlandWaters.2ISO 19115.3 Topic Categories 0aPA. 0aAllegheny County. 0aPittsburgh. 0aSouthwest PA. 0aClairton. 0aMcKeesport. 0aDuquesne. 0aWestern PA.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
