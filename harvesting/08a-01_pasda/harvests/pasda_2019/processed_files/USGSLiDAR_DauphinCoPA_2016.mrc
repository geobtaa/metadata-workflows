No points have been removed or excluded. A visual qualitative assessment was performed to ensure data completeness. No void areas or missing data exist. The raw point cloud is of good quality and data passes Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy specifications.iThe specifications require that only raw Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) be computed for raw lidar point cloud swath files. The raw NVA was tested with 35 independent survey points distributed throughout the project area and located in open terrain. These checkpoints were not used in the calibration or post-processing of the lidar point cloud data. Specifications for this project require that the raw NVA be 19.6 cm or better AccuracyZ at 95 percent confidence level. The specifications require that Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) be computed for DEM files. The NVA was tested with 35 independent survey points distributed throughout the project area and located in open terrain.

The specifications require that Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (VVA) be computed for DEM files. The VVA was tested with 35 independent survey points distributed throughout the project area and located in vegetated terrain. These checkpoints were not used in the calibration or post-processing of the lidar point cloud data. Specifications for this project require that the VVA be 29.4 cm or better at the 95th percentile.j0.059kThe raw NVA was tested using 35 independent survey points located in open terrain. The surveyed checkpoints were distributed throughout the project area and surveyed using GNSS procedures and methodologies that provide reliable and consistent results to meet the project's accuracy requirements. Please see the "Survey Accuracy Requirements" and "Field Methodology" sections in the Survey Report for more information. Elevations from the unclassified lidar surface were measured for the x,y location of each check point. Elevations interpolated from the unclassified lidar surface were then compared to the elevation values of the surveyed control. The RMSEz was computed to be 0.099 meters (0.030 feet) and AccuracyZ to be 0.193 meters (0.059 feet). This meets the required AccuracyZ value of 19.6 cm raw NVA at 95 percent confidence level using (RMSEz * 1.9600) as defined by the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA); assessed and reported using National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP)/ASPRS Guidelines.  aUSGSLiDAR_DauphinCoPA_2016.  aMicroStation Version 8; TerraScan Version 15; TerraModeler Version 15; GeoCue Version 2014.1.21.1; Esri ArcGIS 10; Global Mapper 16; Leica Cloud Pro 1.2; Windows 7 Operating System \\PSIHQ_NX3200\Projects\Projects\28552_USGS_Dauphin_Co 1.11 GB and \\matrix\matrix\LIDAR\28552_USGS_Dauphin_Co_PA_3DEP_BAA 816 GB.  aNone. 0aElevation data. 0aLidar. 0aHydrology. 0aUnited States. 0aUS. 0aPennsylvania. 0aPA. 0aDauphin County.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
