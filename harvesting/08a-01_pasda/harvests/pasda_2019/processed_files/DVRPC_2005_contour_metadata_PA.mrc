The residuals of the final adjustment ensured compliance with NSSDA standards. The Pre Adjustment Gross Error Detection Statistical Test (Data Snooping, with a confidence level of 99.9%) has been applied to all observations included in the aerial triangulations. To detect small gross errors, during Adjustment Robust Estimators were used with the same confidence level and a power of the test of 1-beta=0.2. Systematic errors were eliminated through self calibration and through Additional Parameters. Their numerical stability, statistical significance, internal and external reliability were checked using Student-t test with the same confidence level and Variance/Co-variance analysis. Finally, the arrived variance factor was submitted to a Chi-square test against the pre-adjustment variance factor using a confidence level 99.9%. Evaluation of the DEM includes checking the terrain data for spikes and wells, omissions, and other anomalies that do not meet the project accuracy requirements. The horizontal and vertical accuracy has been tested by comparing the coordinates of well-defined points in the dataset with coordinates of the same points from an independent source of higher accuracy.dAll files are inspected by the Production Manager to ensure that they conform to the specified file naming conventions, all files load in their correct geographic position, all files conform to the project specifications. The data has been checked for duplicate features, correct edge matching, overshoots, undershoots, offsets, overall cartographic appearance.eThe data has been checked to ensure that the boundary and the content has been covered in its entirety.fThe horizontal accuracy standard follows the NSSDA-1998 standard. The maximum permissible RMSE for 95% of the horizontal check points for the mapping product is 5 feet or better.iThe DEM data meets the required vertical accuracy necessary to ensure that the contours meet NMAS for 1"=200', 5' CI mapping.  aDVRPC_2005_contour_metadata_PA.  pWhere applicable, all data conforms to the Proposal for 2005 Aerial Photography Project presented to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission August 5, 2004. 0aContours. 0aTopographic Contours. 0aElevation Contours. 0aElevation. 0aSpot Elevations. 0aControl Points. 0aDTM/DEM. 0aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover. 0aDVRPC Region. 0aPennsylvania. 0aBucks County. 0aChester County. 0aDelaware County. 0aMontgomery County. 0aPhiladelphia County.
