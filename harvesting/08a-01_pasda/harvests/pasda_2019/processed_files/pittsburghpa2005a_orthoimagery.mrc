As a part of the ISTAR workflow, the data from the color channels is edge sharpened using the nadir panchromatic channel. The orthophoto mosaics are inspected for accuracy issues that fall in the following categories: Aerotriangulation related DSM related Accuracy issues will be investigated through review and correction of the DSM or triangulation adjustment. Once the imagery has passed quality control review, final radiometric adjustments are performed to create a uniform overall appearance.dAll GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived. This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements. Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. Seamline mismatches are not corrected unless the overall displacement exceeds one meter.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free. Photography was flown during leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Coastal areas and international boundary regions may have areas without images (void areas) in parts of the coverage. These void areas have a radiometric value of either zero (black) or 128 (uniform gray).fCompliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data. Using several tools that are part of the ISTAR workflow, a digital surface model (DSM) was correlated at a post spacing of 2 meter depending on terrain and land cover. The ISTAR correlation algorithm computes the X,Y,Z value for each DSM post utilizing every stereo angle that is available. A series of DSM files were created for each acquisition block, one for each stereo look angle. A mosaic was then created from the separate DSM files where the best vertical value for each posting was selected from all look angles compared against the aerotriangulation adjustment which is incorporated into the mosaic. EarthData will then edit the surface to the level required to support the orthophoto production. An RMS value was determined by comparing the position of USGS ground test points to their photo-id'ed position in the rectified imagery. This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in meters. 0.40 The horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the accuracy of the aerotriangulation and digital surface model (DSM). For each rectified image (lift), an RMSE value for all of the standard errors of the tie/pass/control points located in that image (lift) and computed by the aerotriangulation solution was calculated. The DSM accuracy assessment was achieved by comparing the aerotriangulation-derived elevation with the elevation of the DSM. In addition, visual examination was employed to assess all tiles and its relative edge match. All results were examined for consistency and its compliance with the NSSDA accuracy standard.  apittsburghpa2005a_orthoimagery.  aLeica ADS40 Digital Camera System ISTAR Digital Image Processing Software Z/I Imaging Orthopro 4.0 Windows NT/2000 Systems.  pU.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1996, Standards for Digital Orthophotos: Reston, VA. 7a0.3 meter orthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7anatural color orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimage map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aUS.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPittsburgh.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aAllegeny County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aBeaver County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aWashington county.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPA.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPittsburgh, PA.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aAllegheny County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aBeaver County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.40zConnect to this dataset online.uftp://pamap.pasda.psu.edu/nga-usgs_imagery/
