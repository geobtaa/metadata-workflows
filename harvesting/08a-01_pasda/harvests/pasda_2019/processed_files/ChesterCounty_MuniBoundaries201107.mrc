Accordingly, these features were compiled from aerial photography dated April 7, 1993, controlled analytically from the ground points captured using first order global positioning system equipment. Planimetric coordinates are based on the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System South Zone and North American Datum 1983.fData same as land base (features built from land base = +- 5 feet accuracy)  aChesterCounty_MuniBoundaries201107.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3500.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7aboundaries.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aplanningCadastre.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7amunicipality.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7acounty.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aChester County.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
