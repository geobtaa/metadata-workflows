Inspections were performed by running the Fish Species Database and comparing results with the original fish records.dEach of the 10875 data entries are represented as individual points, and are therefore not subject to logical consistency errors such as overshoots, dangling nodes, duplicate arcs, etc. Coordinate accuracy was tested by manually verifying geo-referenced species occurrences.eThe integrity of geo-referenced data within the Fish Species Database was verified by running the Database and comparing results with the original fish records. Note: When the Pennsylvania Fish Species Database is downloaded from the PASDA website, the links which connect the supporting text (i.e. tables) files to the ArcView shapefile will be lost. In order to use the Atlas, you must first re-establish the necessary links in your ArcView project. Pafish.shp (destination/active table) is linked (i.e. one-to-many relationship) to pafbcoccur.txt (source table) via "SITE_ID" (in pafish.dbf) and "SITE-ID" (pafbcoccur.txt). Pafbcoccur.txt is joined (i.e. many-to-one relationship) to speciesfile.txt via "SPECIES".fHorizontal positional accuracy was dependant upon the level of detail included in the original fish records, and were tested by manually verifying geo-referenced species occurrences.  afishspeciesoccurrence.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3000.  cOBJECTIDdInternal feature number., ESRIpFor additional entity and attribute information, contact David Argent at (dga3@psu.edu). 7abiodiversity.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7awildlife.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7afish.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aspecies.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ainlandWaters.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
