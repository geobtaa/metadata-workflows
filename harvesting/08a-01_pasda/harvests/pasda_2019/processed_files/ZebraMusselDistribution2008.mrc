But it is a fair and accurate representation of their distribution in North America.fZebra mussel sightings were reported with varying levels of accuracy. Some of the reports were as latitude-longitude coordinates, some as river miles, and others as just a lake, beach, harbor, or a water body and nearest town name. The locations were digitized as a single point in the reported water body at the place nearest to the town. If no specific location was reported in a lake, the point was digitized in the middle. These were all small lakes; the Great Lakes had specific locations associated with them. Each zebra mussel sighting location was checked by manual comparison of the on-screen point with hard copy maps.  aZebraMusselDistribution2008.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.1.0.722.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7abiota.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aAquatic.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aFreshwater.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aExotic.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aZebra mussels.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aDreissena polymorpha.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aGIS.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aLakes.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aNon-native.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aNon-indigenous.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aRivers.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aUnited States.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of 7aCanada.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of 7aOntario.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of 7aQuebec.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html?openChapters=chpbio#chpbio
