Multiple GPS base stations were also running in the project area and were recording data at 1 Hz. The airborne GPS data was post-processed in DGPS mode together with base station data to provide high accuracy aircraft positions. The GPS trajectory then was combined with the IMU data using loosely coupled approach to yield high accuracy aircraft positions and attitude angles. Then the LiDAR data was processed using the aircraft trajectory and raw LiDAR data.dCompliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the collection of ground control and the establishment of a GPS base station at the operation airport as well as multiple other active stations in the project area.eThe DEM raster files cover the entire project delivery boundary. The pixels fall that outside the project delivery boundary are set to Void with a unique (3z(BNODATA(3y(B value. The value is identified in the file headers. There are no void pixels inside the project boundary. A visual qualitative assessment was performed to ensure data completeness. No void areas or missing data exist. The bare earth surface is of good quality and passes Vertical Accuracy requirements.iThe Fundamental Vertical Accuracy (FVA) of the LiDAR Point Cloud data was calculated against TINs derived from the final calibrated and controlled swath data. The required accuracy (ACCZ) is: 18.13 cm at a 95% confidence level, derived according to the National Standard for Spatial Database Accuracy (NSSDA), i.e., based on RMSE of 9.25 cm in the (3z(Bopen terrain(3y(B land cover category.j0.09kTested 0.09 meters vertical accuracy at 95 percent confidence level according to the Federal Geographic Data Committee, 1998, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard, Part 3: National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy, FGDC-STD-007.3-1998.  aPA_SandyLiDAR2015.  aArcGIS 10.2; Global Mapper 14; Fugro proprietary software; Windows XP and 7 Operating Systems \\server\directory path\*.img 21 GB. 7aLiDAR.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aTerrain.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aModel.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aElevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aSurface.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aUS.2Geographic Names Information System 7aPennsylvania.2Geographic Names Information System 7aYork County.2Geographic Names Information System 7aLancaster County.2Geographic Names Information System
