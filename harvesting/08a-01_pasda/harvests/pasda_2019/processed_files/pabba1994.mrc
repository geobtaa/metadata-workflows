All of the USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles for Pennsylvania are accounted for. Each of these quads are further subdivided into six sections, for a total of 4928 sample "blocks". NOTE: The GIS component of the Atlas does not consist of "true" Raster data. Rather, the Shapefile has been divided into 4928 blocks, or cells, of equal size.  aground condition.  avector digital data.  aThe Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) and the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) reserve the right to deny requests for large portions of Atlas data or request reimbursement for handling costs.  aAll attribute data (e.g. species, breeding status, survey hours) have been manually inspected for spatial and content (i.e. typos) accuracy. Inspections were performed by running the Breeding Bird Atlas Database and comparing results with the original, bound/hardcopy Atlas.dEach of the 4928 Atlas sample blocks are represented as individual grid cells, and are therefore not subject to logical consistency errors such as overshoots, dangling nodes, duplicate arcs, etc. Coordinate accuracy was tested by overlaying the Atlas sample blocks with the complete set of Pennsylvania 7.5-minute quadrangles; all Atlas sample blocks fit precisely within their parent quadrangles.eThe integrity of geo-referenced data within the Breeding Bird Atlas Database was verified by running the Atlas and comparing results with the original, bound/hardcopy atlas. Users of the Atlas should note that the supporting dBase files contain accessory data, particularly Bbaname.dbf, which features several items (e.g. "AOU_NUM") that are not essential for the Atlas to function properly. These data appeared in the original Breeding Bird Atlas (non-electronic form), however, and have been preserved here. Note: When the Breeding Bird Atlas Database is downloaded from the PASDA website, the links which connect the supporting dBase files to the ArcView shapefile will be lost. In order to use the Atlas, you must first re-establish the links in your ArcView project. Bba.dbf is linked to Bbadat.dbf and Bbaocc.dbf via "BLOCK_ID". Bbaname.dbf is linked to Bbadat.dbf via "SP_CODE".fHorizontal positional accuracy was tested by overlaying the Atlas sample blocks with the complete set of Pennsylvania 7.5-minute quadrangles; all Atlas sample blocks fit precisely within their parent quadrangles.  apabba1994.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRIpComplete information about the Breeding Bird Atlas Database project for Pennsylvania, including grid block design, breeding codes, volunteer effort, species accounts, and distribution maps, can be found in: Brauning, D.W. 1992.
