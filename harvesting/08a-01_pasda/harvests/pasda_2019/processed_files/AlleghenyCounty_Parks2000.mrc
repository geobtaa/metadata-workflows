Data was produced in a series of 1,362 tiles measuring about 4,600 feet X 3,500 feet. Tiles are numbered in a clockwise spiral fashion starting with #1 at the point in downtown Pittsburgh. Data from most tiles was delivered by 1996 when GIS Operations ceased in Allegheny County, with the exception of one person in the Health Department.eThere is data for all of the municipalities in the county, with some holes in some layers. It is estimated that between 16 and 91 tiles of data might be missing in a layer.fGeodetic reference framrwork was created using NAD 83, the result of the latest geodetic readjustment by NGS at the time. Photography was produced at a scale of 1"=1,500'. Mapping was stereo digitized at a scale of 1"=200'. Map data meets or exceeds map accuracy standards in effect during the spring of 1992.+/- 5 feetiGeodetic reference framrwork was created using NAGVD 29 in conformance with the monument densification program outlined in the County of Allegheny Geodetic Control Report  aAlleghenyCounty_Parks2000.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.1.1332.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7abiota.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aboundaries.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aenvironment.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aeconomy.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7asociety.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPA. 0aPittsburgh. 0aAllegheny County. 0aSouth West PA. 0aWestern PA. 0aClairton. 0aDuquesne. 0aMcKeesport.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
