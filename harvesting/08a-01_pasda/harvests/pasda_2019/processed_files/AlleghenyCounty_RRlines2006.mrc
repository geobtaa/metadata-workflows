A database field has been defined for all map features named "Update Year". This database field will define which dataset provided each map feature. Map features from the current map will be set to "2004". The earlier dataset map features the earlier dataset map features used to supplement the area near the county boundary will be set to "1993". All new or modified map data will have the value for "Update Year" set to "2004".  aCall for Details.  aData was subject to visual check by County GIS Staff for attribute accuracy.dData was subject to QA/QC process by county GIS Staff at the time it was recieved - 1992-1996 and 2004 - 2005. The "<coverage>#" and "<coverage>-ID" items from the 1993 and 1994 ArcInfo coverages have been transferred to the geodatabase for all map features that have not been modified. The purpose of the retention of this data is to allow linking of the geodatabase to the original coverages. The values from the ArcInfo coverage item "<coverage>#" are loaded into the geodatabase field "SystemID". The values from the ArcInfo coverage item "<coverage>-ID" are loaded into the geodatabase field "UserID". All map features that have been modified or added during the 2004 update, with the exception of Street Centerlines, will have the value for "SystemID" and "UserID" set to zero (0).eAs part of the 2004 update project, mapping was provided covering an area extending 1500 feet beyond the county boundary line. All planimetric, contour and DTM features were delivered in ESRI geodatabase format as County-wide seamless Feature Classes.fAll horizontal control is to NGS Second Order Class I accuracy or better and photo control points are reported on the North American Datum (NAD) 1983 U.S. Survey Feet. The aerial photography was captured at a negative scale of 1" = 1,600' and is sufficient to produce mapping at 1" = 200' that conforms to National Mapping Accuracy Standards (NMAS).+/- 5 feetiAll final elevations are referenced to North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988. Orthometric heights utilize GEOID 99. The network adheres to the Federal Geodetic Control Committee Standards (FGCS) guidelines and the final constrained adjustments were made with StarNet Least Squares Adjustment program and are acceptable by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).  aAlleghenyCounty_RRlines2006.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.1.1332.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7atransportation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPA. 0aPittsburgh. 0aClairton. 0aDuquesne. 0aMcKeesport.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
