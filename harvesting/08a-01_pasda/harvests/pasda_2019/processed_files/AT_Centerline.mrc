Length (distance) information was calculated within the GIS though, so may not accurately reflect true distance values such as those calculated on the ground with a wheel or other measuring device. These values may also vary slightly throughout the data set, depending on the source data used to determine length.dInformation within this data set are considered to be logically consistent, though no formal tests were performed. Line geometry is topologically clean.eAll portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail are represented within this data set using the most accurate information available. This includes high accuracy Global Positioning Systems (GPS) data in some areas and digitized information from USGS topographic maps and Appalachian Trail maps in others. As more accurate and up-to-date information is collected or becomes available, it will be incorporated within, or used to update, the current data set.fHorizontal accuracy of this data set varies depending on the source data from which it was compiled. All GPS data used to create this data set were collected using Trimble GeoExplorer II, ProXL, or ProXR GPS equipment and post-process differentially corrected. However, in some areas this included only 2D GPS data (which is generally less accurate than 3D GPS data). Though no formal tests were conducted, all portions of the data based on 3D data are assumed to meet National Mapping Standards of +/- 46.5 feet horizontal accuracy at a 95% confidence level. Portions based on 2D data, however, may exceed National Mapping Standards in some areas. All portions of the data based on GPS data are noted within the attribute information. All digitized information used to create this data set were based on information depicted on USGS 1:24,000 topographic maps or Appalachian Trail maps, which vary in scale from 1:24,000 to 1:100,000. Generally, this information was only used as a supplement to the GPS data (e.g. in areas where no GPS data was collected or where GPS data did not reflect current conditions such as recent relocations). Though no formal tests were conducted, those portions of the data based on USGS topographic map information are assumed to be within National Mapping Standards. Those based on Appalachian Trail map information, however, may exceed National Mapping Standards in some areas. All portions of the data based on digitized information are noted within the attribute information.iNot applicable.  aAT_Centerline.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.5.1450.  aNone.  cFIDdInternal feature number, ESRI 7aAppalachian National Scenic Trail.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aAppalachian Trail.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aNational Scenic Trail.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aA.T.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aAT.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aA.T.
