    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto.  Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines.  These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>"GeoTIFFs conform to the specifications set forth by the USGS for production of orthophotos in the Task Order Number G12PD00343." Logical consistency is implicit in the raster image data structure. Source imagery is cloud free.</logic>
    <complete>"Orthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free."</complete>

        <horizpar>"The 0.30 meter ortho image horizontal accuracy does not exceed 1.52-meters NSSDA 95% confidence (0.88-meters Root Mean Squared (RMSE) Error XY (0.62 meter RMSE X or Y)." 

The relative accuracy is assembled by comparing rectified images generated from adjacent strips of imagery. The absolute accuracy is assessed by measuring the ground control points in the rectified image against the actual surveyed co-ordinate position. The testing is for overall accuracy.  This data has been produced to be fully compliant with the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for mapping at this scale.</horizpar>

Airborne GPS/IMU data was used. All photo identifiable checkpoints were measured and compared to the surveyed checkpoints to determine the RMSE. All rectified chip overlap was checked for mismatch. All final tiles were checked visually for edge matching.</horizpae>

        <procdesc>"The digital images were aero-triangulated to support digital ortho image production for the Pittsburgh, PA project area.  Ground check point data was provided by AeroMetric, Inc.  The project was referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), UTM Zone 17 horizontally and to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) vertically.  Units were in meters.

The images, ABGPS/IMU data, and ground check point data were used as inputs to the Zeiss/Intergraph ImageStation Automatic Triangulation (ISAT) softcopy program.  ISAT correlated image points and aerotriangulated the block of images to create exposure station exterior orientations.  All ground points were manually measured on the imagery.  These points were included in the aerotriangulation adjustments for absolute ground location verification.

The scale of the aerial photos was 1"=2116'.  The photography was exposed between 3/21/12 and 4/7/12.

Rectification was done using the aerotriangulation data, raw images, and PAMAP DEM data.  These rectified images were used to generate seamlines which were then reviewed and edited. The rectified images were mosaicked, balanced, and cut into final image sheets.  The final sheets were viewed and artifacts were removed as well as other edits performed."</procdesc>

Each image pixel is assigned a triplet of numeric values, one for each color band.  Numeric values range from 0 to 255. Areas where data is incomplete due to lack of full image coverage are represented with the numeric value of 0.</eaover>
