Sitler under the supervision of G.W.White, 1959, Bulletin G-32, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. The original map was published at a scale of 1:125,000. Three counties are fully covered by these deposits and mapped (Crawford, Erie, and Mercer); five more are partially covered and mapped (Beaver, Butler, Lawrence, Warren, and Venango). \r\nThis GIS dataset shows the areal distribution of 14 distinct glacial deposits from the Pleistocene Epoch and Recent stream alluvium and/or bedrock exposures. All mapping activity and lithologic interpretations were made by the original authors of the map (Shepps et al., 1959); the authors of this electronic geospatial resource (Shaffer et al., 2005) have only provided digital transfer of the map features and attributes and documentation of the process. Purpose:\r\nThis dataset identifies the distribution of surficial unconsolidated sediments (glacial deposits and stream alluvium) in northwestern PA. This map is the only published comprehensive regional surficial geologic map available for the region. The original map was digitized to provide an electronic version for GIS work. Potential users should read the Supplemental Information Section (below) to determine the appropriate scale for using these data. More detailed surficial geologic maps may exist within the mapped area in either paper or electronic format.

The objective of the cultural assessment is to identify lands that provide cultural assets and further inform preservation efforts with spatial information about cultural lands. This spatial information about cultural resources can provide an added value to land preservation because cultural lands provide a historic perspective for interpreting land and people's relationship with it.

The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape. I found that much of the watershed was still fairly intact, although this varied dramatically by ecoregion. Current protection also varied, and an assessment of vulnerability will help focus protection efforts among the most valuable hubs and corridors.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Some boundary details clarified by Philadelphia City Planning Commission May 2011"",)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.xml',)",ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/philacity/data/PhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.zip

"(u'Philadelphia Census Tracts 2010',)","(u'2010',)","(u'City of Philadelphia',)","(u""Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at ten square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 Orthophotography and 2008 LiDAR LAS data.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (building footprints, road polygons, and hydrography) provided by City of Philadelphia. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2008. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.

These atlas sheets were produced from 9x9"" aerial\r\nphotos. The imagery dates from the years 1959, 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990,\r\n& 1995. The 1959s and 1965s primarily cover the urbanized portion of\r\nthe DVRPC region (the DVRPC region is made up of nine counties: Bucks, Chester,\r\nDelaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; Burlington, Camden,\r\nGloucester, and Mercer in New Jersey). Subsequent years provide full coverage of the\r\nregion, minus the occasional missing scan.\r\nIn order to increase the efficiency of using the historical aerial imagery, the sheets were\r\nscanned into TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files. Each TIFF file ranges between 35-\r\n40MB in size. Unlike DVRPC\u2019s more recent aerial imagery (2000 and later), the\r\nhistorical aerials are not \u201corthorectified\u201d or \u201corthocorrected\u201d. In other words, they are\r\nsimply aerial images with no spatial reference or uniform scale. Through the process of\r\ngeoreferencing, the scanned images can be assigned a spatial reference which will\r\nenable them to be used more readily in a GIS environment. That said, georeferencing is\r\nnot orthorectifying or orthocorrecting. What it does allow is for the scan to be displayed\r\nrelative to other spatially referenced GIS layers. A georeferenced scan does not have\r\nthe properties of an actual orthoimage. Whereas an orthoimage can be used for making\r\naccurate measurements, a georeferenced image cannot, as it does not have the spatial\r\naccuracy and uniform scale of an orthoimage. \n\r\nftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/dvrpc/DVRPC_Historical_Aerials/Indexes/DVRPC_Historical_Aerial_Index_Maps.pdf\r\nhttps://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/TileIndex/',)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=DVRPC_HistoricImagery59_00.xml',)",ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/dvrpc/DVRPC_Historical_Aerials/

Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added.  Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile.  The canopy coverage percentage was interpreted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement.  At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none).  \r\n\r\n   - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream.\r\n   - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.\r\n   - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.\r\n\r\nThe threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft.  If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines.  Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline.  In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides.\r\n\r\nPonds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis.  Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value.  \r\n\r\nEdits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious.  The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes.  The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines.  \r\n\r\nStream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value.  \r\n\r\nTen sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007.',)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=Heritage_BerksRiparianStreams2007.xml',)",ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/heritage_conservancy/RBA_Berks_County

The data sets were digitized primarily from the artwork used\r\nfor the 1980 ""Geologic Map of Pennsylvania"" (Berg, T. M., Edmunds, W. E., Geyer,\r\nA. R., and others, compilers, 1980, Geologic map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania\r\nGeological Survey, 4th ser., Map 1, scale 1:250,000) and from source materials used for\r\nthat map. Many of the source materials had been published as page-sized maps and were\r\ndigitized from this published paper copy (Berg, T. M., and Dodge, C. M., 1981, Atlas of\r\npreliminary geologic quadrangle maps of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey,\r\n4th ser., Map 61, scale approx. 1:62,500). The other source materials consist of\r\nunpublished and published maps at various scales. It was beyond the scope of the project\r\nto incorporate revisions that had been made to the geologic units since the 1980 map was\r\ncompiled; however, some updates to formational contacts, faults, and dikes, as well as to\r\ngeologic nomenclature and ages, were incorporated where the revisions could be easily\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe 1980 Pennsylvania state geologic map (Berg and others, 1980) shows the areal\r\ndistribution of 194 bedrock geologic units. The units range in geologic age from\r\nQuaternary to Precambrian and encompass a wide variety of lithologies. The map was\r\ncompiled and published in a transverse mercator projection at 1:250,000 scale. The two\r\ndigital data sets include 195 geologic units, which, for the most part, closely correspond to\r\nthose shown on the 1980 map. The data sets were prepared using ArcInfo software and\r\nare provided in a geographic coordinate system (units in decimal degrees). Although it is\r\npossible to portray digital data at any scale, the geologic formational contacts, faults, and\r\ndikes represented in these data sets are not intended to be used at any scale finer than\r\n1:250,000.\r\n\r\nThe polygon attributes in the data set for geologic contacts and faults include unit\r\nnumber, map symbol, name, age, and three lithology categories that represent the general\r\nlithologic makeup of each geologic unit. Each arc (line) in the data set is attributed as\r\none or more of the three general categories of contact, fault, or border. Contact lines are\r\nattributed according to the type of contact shown on the 1980 map (solid, dashed,\r\nqueried, or arbitrary). Fault lines are similarly attributed (solid, dashed, or queried).\r\nBorders are attributed as either state boundaries, quadrangle boundaries, or the shoreline\r\nof Lake Erie.

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. \r\nCensus tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \r\nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. \r\nCensus tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties.

"(u'Stormwater 167',)","(u'2018',)","(u'Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection',)","(u'Stormwater management involves the control of water that runs off the surface of the land from rain or melting ice or snow. The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans.

The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources.\r\nThis layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them.  Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.

All records are organized by the Atlas region. Various attributes of the Atlas block are incorporated, including geographic features (physiographic locations), effort (hours of fieldwork). The species segment, being replicated the full 320,000 times, was kept to a minimal size, and lists only the species and breeding code, the year and comment.

""Observed,"" ""Possible,"" ""Probable,"" and ""Confirmed"" breeding codes represent increasing evidence that nesting occurred within the block a species was recorded. ""Probable"" and ""Confirmed"" categories were further segregated into hierarchical codes that represent individual breeding behaviors or physical evidence of nesting. A description of breeding codes may be provided upon request. All of Pennsylvania\'s 4,928 atlas ""blocks"" were surveyed, with an average of 65 species per block recorded.

More than two thousand dedicated birdwatchers completed surveys of birds across the state from 2004 to 2009. The data amassed reveal the distribution of each species and show changes in distribution since the publication of the first Atlas. The core results of the project are the distribution maps. In fact, up to three maps per species show in fine detail the current distribution of all breeding birds based on the second Atlas, changes in distribution since the first Atlas, and, for more than one hundred species, their density across Pennsylvania.The field project was based at Powdermill Nature Reserve, environmental research center of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Rector, Pennsylvania. Bob Mulvihill and Mike Lanzone were project co-coordinators. Following the recommendations of the North American Ornithological Atlas Committee, the basic survey unit was the \u201cblock,\u201d defined as one-sixth of a standard U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map, of which 4,937 were identified for survey coverage. Local coordination was provided by volunteer Regional Coordinators, who provided the foundation for organizing fieldwork. Eventually, 83 individuals served as Regional Coordinators (see the list under the Credits tab).Breeding bird atlases employ a set of codes to record the behaviors associated with nesting activity, ranging from the simplest detection by sight or sound, through confirmation of active nests and fledged young. Birds observed in breeding habitat, and within their particular breeding season, were placed in one of four categories based on breeding evidence \u2014 observations outside breeding habitat, or Possible, Probable, or Confirmed breeding \u2014 with a two-letter code used for confirmed breeding evidence and single letter codes for all other categories (See Project Methods \u2013 Breeding Codes). The second Atlas did not recommend undue effort to confirm breeding of common species, because it was believed that the field time could be better spent compiling species lists from multiple blocks.

TWI results in a dimensionless raster and should be displayed using a red (low values representing no flow) to blue (high, representing high probability flowpaths) color gradient.

This allows condition to be assessed using metrics, such as those tabulated using GIS tools found in Fragstats (McGarigal & Marks, 1995), to be consistently calculated within ecological units like watersheds and political units like counties.

These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\r\n\r\nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area."",)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=cb_2015_42_tract_500k.xml',)",ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/census/cb_2015_42_tract_500k.zip

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Maryland\r\n\r\n      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.\r\n\r\n      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.\r\n\r\n      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis.

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery.

The request was to perform a topographic\r\nchange grid analysis for the Frankford 7.5-minute quadrangle, 1:24,000-scale\r\ntopographic map, which includes the Wissinoming neighborhood, and the Germantown 7.5-minute quadrangle, which includes the Logan and Feltonville neighborhoods of the City of Philadelphia. The following tasks were performed under this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in elevation between the modern and historic surveys. Prior to release, the fully documented GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was reviewed for (1) com-pleteness of documentation and for (2) appropriate analysis and discussion of uncertainties.\r\nThe following report is in fulfillment of the tasks outlined in this scope of work and was performed by the U.

Dataset Description: Allentown, Pennsylvania 2016 QL1 LiDAR project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and production of products derivative of LIDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania South Zone, US survey feet and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID 12B), US survey feet. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 129 individual 2,500-foot X 2,500-foot tiles, 1-foot hydro-flattened bare-earth raster DEMs in ERDAS .IMG format and intensity images in GeoTIFF format, tiled to the same 2,500-foot X 2,500-foot tile schema. Hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. A mosaic of the hydro-flattened bare-earth raster DEMs was produced in ERDAS .IMG format.

This data is part of a series of inundation layers meant to correlate observations and forecasts from the river gage with a visual representation of the areas impacted by high water. The data set of flood inundation areas was created from flood scenarios generated by HEC-RAS runs provided by USACE-Baltimore and LiDAR data from PASDA processed to extract bare earth points. A shapefile of inundation area for each stage was created and subsequently merged to form continuous datasets for the main-stem Susquehanna River and backwater areas on its tributaries.This data was developed to assist the public and emergency officials with planning and response to high water episodes at or near a defined National Weather Service river forecast point."",)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=USACE_DepthGrid_HarrisburgFloodInundation.xml',)",ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/usace/

The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.

This layer consists of three classes of tree canopy: 1) no change, 2) loss, and 3) gain. No change indicates that the tree canopy has not changed substantially from 2006 to 2011. Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data.

Large areas and areas that are minimally disturbed by development provide the backbone that links habitats and allows plants and animals to shift and move across sizable portions of the landscape.

A Landscape Conservation Area (LCA) is defined as an area a large contiguous area that is important because of its size, open space, habitats, and/or inclusion of one or more Biological Diversity Areas.
