The primary limiting factor for the level of detail of the source is the scale of the source materials. The proper selection of grid spacing determines the level of content that may be extracted from a given source during digitization.dThe fidelity of the relationships encoded in the data structure of the DEM are automatically verified using a USGS software program upon completion of the data production cycle. The test verifies full compliance to the DEM specification.eThe DEM is visually inspected for completeness on a DEM view and edit system for the purpose of performing a final quality control and if necessary edit of the DEM. The physical format of each digital elevation model is validated for content completeness and logical consistency during production quality control and prior to archiving in the National Digital Cartographic Data Base. Due to the variable orientation of the quadrilateral in relation to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection grid, profiles that pass within the bounds of the DEM quadrilateral, may be void of elevation grid points, and are not represented in the DEM. This condition occurs infrequently and is always the first or last profile of the dataset. Level 2 DEM: Level 2 DEM's may contain void areas due to interruptions to contours in the source graphic or DLG. Void area elevation grid posts are assigned the value of -32,767. In addition, suspect elevation areas may exist in the DEM but are not specifically identified. Suspect areas can be located on the source graphic as a "disturbed surface, " symbolized by contours overprinted with photorevised or other surface patterns.fThe horizontal accuracy of the DEM is expressed as an estimated root mean square error (RMSE). The estimate of the RMSE is based upon horizontal accuracy tests of the DEM source materials which are selected as equal to or less than intended horizontal RMSE error of the DEM. The testing of horizontal accuracy of the source materials isaccomplished by comparing the planimetric (X and Y) coordinates of well-defined ground points with the coordinates of the same points as determined from a source of higher accuracy.iThe vertical RMSE statistic is used to describe the vertical accuracy of a DEM, encompassing both random and systematic errors introduced during production of the data. The RMSE is encoded in element number 5 of record C of the DEM. Accuracy is computed by a comparison of linear interpolated elevations in the DEM with corresponding known elevations. Test points are well distributed, representative of the terrain, and have true elevations with accuracies well within the DEM accuracy criteria. Acceptable test points include, in order of preference: field control, aerotriangulated test points, spot elevations, or points on contours from existing source maps with appropriate contour interval. A minimum of 28 test points per DEM is required to compute the RMSE, which is composed of a single test using 20 interior points and 8 edge points. Edge points are those which are located along, at, or near the quadrangle neatlines and are deemed by the editor to be useful to evaluating the accuracy of the edge of the DEM. Collection of test point data and comparison of the DEM with the quadrangle hypsography are conducted by the quality control units within the USGS. There are three types of DEM vertical errors; blunder, systematic and random. These errors are reduced in magnitude by editing but cannot be completely eliminated. Blunder errors are those errors of major proportions and are easily identified and removed during interactive editing. Systematic errors are those errors that follow some fixed pattern and are introduced by data collection procedures and systems. These error artifacts include: vertical elevation shifts, misinterpretation of terrain surface due to trees, buildings and shadows, and fictitious ridges, tops, benches or striations. Random errors result from unknown or accidental causes. DEM's are edited to correctly depict elevation surfaces that correspond to water bodies of specified size. Level 1 DEM: A RMSE of 7-meters or less is the desired accuracy standard. A RMSE of 15-meters is the maximum permitted. A 7.5-minute DEM at this level has an absolute elevation error tolerance of 50 meters (approximately three times the 15-meter RMSE) for blunder errors for any grid node when compared to the true elevation. Any array of points in the DEM can not encompass more than 49 contiguous elevations in error by more than 21 meters (three times the 7-meter RMSE). Systematic errors that are within stated accuracy standards are tolerated. Level 2 DEM: A vertical RMSE of one-half of the contour interval, determined by the source map, is the maximum permitted. Systematic errors may not exceed one contour interval, determined by the source map, is the maximum permitted. Systematic errors may not exceed one contour interval specified by the source graphic. Level 2 DEMs have been processed or smoothed for consistency and edited to remove identifiable systematic errors.  aabbottstown_pa-zip.  pU.S.Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Digital Elevation Models -- Data Users Guide; Reston, VA, A hypertext extract is available at: URL: http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/glis/hyper/guide/usgs_dem Softcopies in ASCII and WordPerfect format are available at: URL: ftp://mapping.usgs.gov/pub/ti/DEM/ U.S.Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1992, Standards for digital elevation models: Reston, VA, Softcopies in ASCII and WordPerfect format are available at: URL: ftp://mapping.usgs.gov/pub/ti/DEM/ 7aDEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital elevation model.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aelevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital terrain model.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ahypsography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaltitude.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aAbbottstown Quadrangle.2none 7aPennsylvania.2none40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/02289nem a2200349Ia 4500008004100000034004900041100009400090245004900184255005500233260011100288270007900399310001400478342008100492343001100573352001100584500002200595500002500617506001000642514062500652520004601277538009701323552004001420650004101460650010601501650004301607650004901650650004201699650005901741650005801800651001801858856006301876040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-80.573775e-78.546339f41.306125g39.71040110aPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of District Mining Operations10aActive Underground Permit Boundaries 201801.  c(-80.573775 -- -78.546339/41.306125 -- 39.710401).  aCoal Center, PAbPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of District Mining Operations  aDEP- California District OfficebCoal CentercPAdUSAe15423k724-769-1100  cAs needed  t1.000000uExplicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates  bmeters  aVector  apublication date.  avector digital data.  aNone.  aSeveral attributes contain details of mine names, operators, status, and other details of mining operations.

Ninety percent of all elevations from contours will have an accuracy, with respect to true elevation, of within of one half of the contour interval. Ten percent of elevations will not be in error by more than one contour interval. The contours are created from the DTM Feature Dataset. Contours are divided into two (2) main groups; Index Contours and Intermediate Contours. Every fifth contour is classified as an Index Contour and has an elevation interval of a multiple of 25'. Index Contours will be labeled with annotation displaying the elevation of the contour. Contours will not be broken for the placement of the contour label. The contour will be drawn through the label. All other contours are Intermediate Contours. Where appropriate, contours are assigned an additional classification of Hidden, Obscure and Depression. Contours that are created and fall within a building or under a bridge, as a result of creating continuous contours, are coded as Hidden. Obscure Contours are contours that are in an area where the ground is obscured from view on the aerial photography. Obscure Contours will also fall within an Obscure Area Boundary. The Obscure Contours should not be considered accurate as they only give a general representation of the surface of the earth. Depression Contours are closed contours that form a sunken area (depression). Some depressions can cover a large area of land and may not be seen as a depression at a large scale. The contours were created using Bentely SelectCAD software and the following settings: " Import Surface o Thin Surface: Off o Breaklines " Maximum Segment Length: Off " Point Density:Off o Mass Points " Maximum Segment Length:Off " Triangulate Surface o Maximum Length: 0.0 o Filter Tolerance: 0.0 " View Contours: o Display As Linestring o Minimum Area: 500.0 o Clip Contours on Steep Slopes: No o Smooth: OndData was subject to QA/QC process at the time it was created.

In addition, WAMS software (USFWS-NWI) tests the attributes against a master set of valid wetland attributes.dPolygons intersecting the neatline are closed along the border. Segments making up the outer and inner boundareies of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. Line segments are a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs. No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a data string. Intersecting lines are separated into individual line segments at the point of intersection. Point data are represented by two sets of coordinate pairs, each with the same coordinate values. All nodes are represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or end of a line segment. The neatline is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file. All data crossing the neatline are clipped to the neatline and data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Tests for logical consistency are performed by WAMS verification software (USFWS-NWI).eAll photo-interpretable wetlands are mapped. In the treeless prairies, 1/4 acre wetlands are mapped. In forested areas, small open water and emergent wetlands are mapped. In general, the minimum mapping units is from 1 to 3 acres depending on the wetland type and the scale and emulsion of the source aerial photography. In regions of the country where evergreen forested wetlands predominate, wetlands smaller than 3 acres may not be mapped. Thus, a detailed on-the ground and historical analysis of a single site may result in a revision of the wetland boundaries established through photographic interpretation. In addition, some small wetlands and those obscured by dense forest cover may not be included in this dataset. The NWI maps were originally created to represent wetlands throughout the United States. Allegheny County GIS then clipped the national map data to conform to the boundary of Allegheny County. The maps were also projected to GCS_North_American_1983, NAD_1983_StatePlane_Pennsylvania_South_FIPS_3702_Feet by Allegheny County GIS.fHorizontal positional accuracy for the digital data is tested by visual comparison of the source with hard copy plots.+/- 5 feet  aAlleghenyCounty_NWI2000.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.1.1332.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7aenvironment.2ISO 19115.3 Topic Categories 7ageoscientificInformation.2ISO 19115.3 Topic Categories 7ainlandWaters.2ISO 19115.3 Topic Categories 0aPA. 0aAllegheny County. 0aPittsburgh. 0aSouthwest PA. 0aClairton. 0aMcKeesport. 0aDuquesne. 0aWestern PA.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu02044nem a2200361Ia 4500008004100000034004900041100008800090245003700178255005500215270007800270310001100348342008100359343001600440352001100456500002200467500002500489506002200514514064400536520003501180538009701215552006301312650004401375650004101419650005101460651000801511651002201519651001601541651001401557651001401571651001601585651001801601856006301619040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-80.374573e-79.653515f40.701059g40.12179310aAllegheny County Division of Computer Services Geographic Information Systems Group10aAllegheny County Parcels 201802.  c(-80.374573 -- -79.653515/40.701059 -- 40.121793).  a621 County Office BuildingbPittsburghcPAdUSAe15219-2952k412 350-4774  cWeekly  t1.000000uExplicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates  bsurvey feet  aVector  apublication date.  avector digital data.  aCall for details.  aData is based on Allegheny County Base Data which was produced at a scale of 1"=200'.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. Purpose: SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Supplemental_Information: Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be available from the primary organization listed in the Point of Contact.

Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s). Logical_Consistency_Report: Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.   aThe Soil Survey of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania is edge matched to the adjacent SSURGO (Soil SURvey GeOgraphic) certified Pennsylvania Soil Surveys of Beaver and Lawrence Counties, Greene and Washington Counties, Butler County, Armstrong County and Westmoreland County. The northeast corner of Allegheny County is joined to the southwest corner of Armstrong County. All of the feature edges for this soil survey match the feature edges in the Butler County Soil Survey. Most of the feature edges for this soil survey match the feature edges in the other adjacent soil surveys. Some of the labels for this soil survey match the labels in the adjacent soil surveys. The soil survey boundary for Allegheny County matches the soil survey boundaries of the adjacent certified soil surveys. Completeness_Report: A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified on the map is a delineation. Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas that have properties and behavior significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map. A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas (map unit components), each with a designated range in proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little or no recognizable soil. Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units, and location of special soil features. These standards are outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993, USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995, USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS. The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on data collected by scientists during the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and undifferentiated groups. Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting. Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist of two or more dissimilar components that occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether complex or association is used in the name. The major components of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In either case, because the major components are sufficiently different in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association, each major component is normally present though their proportions may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent. Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two or more components that are not consistently associated geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in the same map delineation. These components are included in the same named map unit because their use and management are the same or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations. Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend, one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per 3,000 acres. A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about 5 acres. Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000 feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units. For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

Source_Contribution: attribute (tabular) information Process_Step: Process_Description: The Northeast Technical Service Center approved the Classification and Correlation of the Soils of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in July, 1973. The Soil Survey of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania was published in 1981 at a scale of 1:15840. The published soil survey was considered to be an acceptable compilation source by the Pennsylvania Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists. Ratioed film positives of the publication annotation overlays were produced at the scale of 1:24000. The soil boundaries were manually compiled on a stable-base film registered to a 7.5 minute quadrangle orthophotograph. Pennsylvania soil scientists used photographic interpretation of orthophotographs, topographic quadrangles and the ratioed film positives of the published soil survey as a reference for soil line placement. Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: SCS1, NRCS1, NRCS2, NRCS3, USGS1 USGS2 Process_Date: 1999 Process_Step: Process_Description: The annotated compilation overlays were raster scanned by Midwest Graphics Inc. at 300 dpi on a drum scanner. Four control points corresponding to the four corners of the quadrangle were used for registration during data collection. The soil scientists and cartographic technicians at the Pennsylvania NRCS Map Compilation and Digitizing Center used the LT4X software for soil data development, which included raster editing, map neatline development, vector conversion, labeling, edge matching and vector editing. The cleaned vector files were imported into the ARC/INFO Version 8 software for final plotting, edit checks, and error analysis. The quadrangle coverages were then joined together into a seamless county coverage. Polygon attributes were checked against the correlation legend. The limit of the soil survey was adjusted to match the DOQ imagery.   aThe adjacent soil surveys in digital format were joined, edited and clipped out to provide a common county boundary among the soil surveys. The data were created and maintained in North American Datum 1983. Statistics on map unit acreages were generated and checked with the correlation legend and tabular data. The tables containing the soil attributes and interpretations were downloaded from the State Survey Database or the National Soil Information System (NASIS) database where appropriate. The soil scientists and cartographic technicians at the Pennsylvania NRCS Map Compilation Center did a 100 percent quality review of the digitized product. The MLRA Region 13 Office Team Leader in Morgantown, West Virginia certified the digitizing on March 8, 2006. The ARCGIS geodatabase for the Allegheny County Soil Survey was posted on the Pennsylvania NRCS Map Compilation and Digitizing Center website. Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: NRCS3, NRCS4, NRCS5, USGS2 Process_Date: 2006 Process_Step: Process_Description: The National Soil Information System (NASIS) database was developed by NRCS soil scientists according to national standards. The MIDU staff provided the Pennsylvania State Soil Scientist with the map unit symbols and acreages from the spatial data. Amendment 2 was drafted to add 10 soil mapping units and 3 miscellaneous land types. Amendment 3 was drafted to correct the slope phase of a soil mapping unit. The soil scientists used the map unit acreages from the digital soil survey as a guide to populate the NASIS database. Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: NRCS6 Process_Date: 2006 Process_Step: Process_Description: The MIDU staff downloaded the ARCGIS geodatabase for the Allegheny County Soil Survey from the Pennsylvania NRCS Map Compilation and Digitizing Center website. The soils and special soil features (point and linear) in the geodatabase were converted to ARC/INFO coverages. The MIDU staff checked the soil survey coverages with a set of ARC Macro Language (AML) programs developed by NCGC. The soil survey coverages were processed using the January 2006 SSURGO Certification AML programs for seamless projects. These ARC/INFO programs identified areas within the coverages that needed revision. The data were edited. The Pennsylvania NRCS soil scientists supplied the SSURGO download from NASIS. The minor codes in the soils coverages were replaced with the map unit key codes to link the map units in the spatial data to the NASIS database. Upon successful completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the area symbol was added to each feature in the soil survey coverages with the att_check.aml program. The county coverages and the metadata were electronically transferred to the NRCS Staging Server to be joined with the tabular data. Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: NRCS5, NRCS6 Process_Date: 2006 Process_Step: Process_Description: The Natural Resources Conservation Service State Soil Scientist or delegate, upon completion of data quality verification, determined that the tabular data should be released for official use. A selected set of map units and components in the soil survey legend was copied to a staging database, and rating values for selected interpretations were generated. The list of selected interpretations is stored in the database table named sainterp. Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: NASIS Process_Date: 20060914 Process_Step: Process_Description: The Natural Resources Conservation Service State Soil Scientist or delegate verified that the labels on the digitized soil map units link to map units in the tabular database, and certified the joined data sets for release to the Soil Data Warehouse. A system assigned version number and date stamp were added and the data were copied to the data warehouse. The tabular data for the map units and components were extracted from the data warehouse and reformatted into the soil data delivery data model, then stored in the Soil Data Mart. The spatial data were copied to the Soil Data Mart without change.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The map unit key is used to link to information in the National Soil Information System tables. Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil Information System database. This attribute database gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation, agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil. The National Soil Information System database contains static metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these database objects. Attributes include table and column descriptions and detailed domain information. The National Soil Information System database also contains a distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed data. Special features are described in the feature table. It includes an area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.

No points have been removed or excluded. A visual qualitative assessment was performed to ensure data completeness. No void areas or missing data exist. The raw point cloud is of good quality and data passes Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy specifications.iThe specifications require that only raw Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) be computed for raw lidar point cloud swath files. The raw NVA was tested with 20 independent survey points distributed throughout the project area and located in open terrain. These checkpoints were not used in the calibration or post-processing of the lidar point cloud data. Specifications for this project require that the raw NVA be 19.6 cm or better AccuracyZ at 95 percent confidence level.j0.03kThe raw NVA was tested using 20 independent survey points located in open terrain. The surveyed checkpoints were distributed throughout the project area and surveyed using GNSS procedures and methodologies that provide reliable and consistent results to meet the project's accuracy requirements. Please see the Survey Report for more information. Elevations from the unclassified lidar surface were measured for the x,y location of each check point.

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.dAll GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived. This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements. Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. Seamline mismatches are corrected unless the overall displacement is less than one pixel.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free.fPlease see the Accuracy Analyst report for a detailed report showing the 14 control points measured to produce the NSSDA value of 0.199 meters (0.652 feet).

Length (distance) information was calculated within the GIS though, so may not accurately reflect true distance values such as those calculated on the ground with a wheel or other measuring device. These values may also vary slightly throughout the data set, depending on the source data used to determine length.dInformation within this data set are considered to be logically consistent, though no formal tests were performed. Line geometry is topologically clean.eAll portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail are represented within this data set using the most accurate information available. This includes high accuracy Global Positioning Systems (GPS) data in some areas and digitized information from USGS topographic maps and Appalachian Trail maps in others. As more accurate and up-to-date information is collected or becomes available, it will be incorporated within, or used to update, the current data set.fHorizontal accuracy of this data set varies depending on the source data from which it was compiled. All GPS data used to create this data set were collected using Trimble GeoExplorer II, ProXL, or ProXR GPS equipment and post-process differentially corrected. However, in some areas this included only 2D GPS data (which is generally less accurate than 3D GPS data). Though no formal tests were conducted, all portions of the data based on 3D data are assumed to meet National Mapping Standards of +/- 46.5 feet horizontal accuracy at a 95% confidence level. Portions based on 2D data, however, may exceed National Mapping Standards in some areas. All portions of the data based on GPS data are noted within the attribute information. All digitized information used to create this data set were based on information depicted on USGS 1:24,000 topographic maps or Appalachian Trail maps, which vary in scale from 1:24,000 to 1:100,000. Generally, this information was only used as a supplement to the GPS data (e.g. in areas where no GPS data was collected or where GPS data did not reflect current conditions such as recent relocations). Though no formal tests were conducted, those portions of the data based on USGS topographic map information are assumed to be within National Mapping Standards. Those based on Appalachian Trail map information, however, may exceed National Mapping Standards in some areas. All portions of the data based on digitized information are noted within the attribute information.iNot applicable.  aAT_ShelterLoactions.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.5.1450.  aNone.  cShapedFeature geometry, ESRI 7aAppalachian National Scenic Trail.2ISO19115 Topic Categories 7aAppalachian Trail.2ISO19115 Topic Categories 7aNational Scenic Trail.2ISO19115 Topic Categories 7aA.T.2ISO19115 Topic Categories 7aAT.2ISO19115 Topic Categories 7aA.T.

Others were reported as just a mountain, park, or waterway. Each location was digitized to the nearest hundredth of a geographic degree as a single point based on the best description provided.

All of the trend information can be retrieved from BBS web site: http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/.  aIn the early years, the data set had 500-600 routes. There are now more than 3000 routes. These routes are checked manually and computer edits performed. However, when there were only 500 routes, this was easier to accomplish. The computer performs edits for computational errors, species range errors. Print outs are sent back to original observer to verify. Many patterns occur in geographic coverage of the BBS. Some patterns occur as a consequence of logistics. BBS routes near human population centers tend to be consistently surveyed but remote routes are not surveyed every year, which causes regional variation in the efficiency of the survey (Robbins et al. 1986). Although all States and Provinces vary in coverage over time, some consistent regional patterns occur in BBS coverage. Coverage in the Northeastern United States (excluding ME) is most extensive, with the highest density of BBS routes (up to 16 per degree block of latitude and longitude) occurring in MD, DE, and NJ (See also Table 1). Routes are much less densely distributed elsewhere with maxima of 4-5 routes / degree block in a number of states while NV and portions of some Canadian Provinces have a minimum of 1 route degree block. Route densities are less than 1 route / degree block only in arctic and boreal regions. In Canada, the BBS is largely restricted to the south, and our summary maps truncate the range of each species to indicate the region with sufficient BBS data. Superimposed on the regional variation in route densities is temporal variation in the number of routes run in many states. Most states show a general pattern of increasing routes over time. In some cases, this pattern is extreme, with states such as ME having few routes until the early 1970's, when numbers started to increase. Some states (e.g., UT) have had consistently low numbers of routes over most of the survey period, while other states (VT, SC, SD) have had periods when the number of routes decreased. For some States and Provinces (e.g., Alaska, Yukon, PEI and NFD), the few years routes were run clearly invalidates any trend analyses from the data. Efficiency of the BBS Sample Overall sampling efficiency of the BBS for each bird species by examining sampling attributes over the entire range of the BBS, and categorized them as (1) not sampled by the BBS, (2) small sample-size, (3) highly variable, or (4) low relative abundance. Possession of one of these attributes does not necessarily eliminate the species from trend analyses. These species can be well surveyed by the BBS within portions of their breeding range or during certain time periods. However, long-term regional or survey-wide trend estimates for these species should be used with caution. Numbers presented below were taken from an unpublished manuscript by Sauer and Droege, and use trend data from 1966 - 1990. The Species not sampled by the BBS-North American bird species that were seen on no more than 1 BBS route fall into broad categories of northern breeders (note that Alaskan BBS routes are not included in standard BBS analyses), tropical or Mexican resident species, pelagic or coastal species, accidental species, and exotics. Small sample-size species-These species have trend estimates with fewer than 14 degrees of freedom, which means that ([number of routes] - [number of strata within states in which the species occurred] < 14). The 99 species seen on few routes of the BBS fall into several general categories, most of which are related to breeding ranges or habitats of the species. Many northern-breeding species and coastal colonial species are seen on some BBS routes, but must be considered accidental occurrences on the BBS. Many tropical and Mexican species are seen on routes in southern Florida and near the Mexican border. Several species of owls and species with northern ranges are only infrequently recorded on BBS routes. Although some species listed by or under review for Endangered Species status are occasionally detected on BBS routes, the BBS provides little information of use for evaluating their population status. None of the BBS guilds contain a high proportion of species with extremely low sample sizes, and overall, 20% of all species seen on BBS routes are sampled with < 14 degrees of freedom. Highly variable species-Eighty-four species had trends with large variances. Several heron species, many duck species, waterbirds, a few species with northern breeding ranges, several warblers, some sparrow species, and some blackbirds occur in this list, among other species. These species can be characterized as birds with specialized habitats or limited distributions in the BBS range, spruce-budworm species, or colonial nesting species. Overall, 22% of the species in the survey were in this category, with hunted species, coniferous forest nesting species, waterfowl, and wetland nesting species guilds having > 22% of their species with high variances. Low relative abundance species - Ninety-five species had rangewide average counts of < 0.5 birds/route in the BBS. This list has similar species categories as the highly variable and low sample size lists, including the widely distributed nocturnal birds, rails, hawks, ducks, and species whose breeding ranges only partially overlap with regions surveyed by the BBS. Several species that are widely distributed but sampled at low numbers on the BBS occur in this list, such as Wood Ducks, American Woodcock, and Great Horned Owl. Overall, 20 % of the species contained in the BBS data had low relative abundances, and the only guilds with 20 % of species in this category were the hunted and primary cavity nesting guilds. Overall, 204 (41%) of the 504 species we analyzed for 25-year trends were in at least one of the categories. The guild with the lowest proportion of species in the lists was urban species (8%), while hunted, wetland nesting, and waterfowl guilds had > 41% of their species in 1 of the 3 categories. Biases in BBS analyses Other potential biases in the BBS cannot be documented from analysis of the survey. These biases were discussed in the publication (Bystrak 1981, Droege 1990), and we will only mention them here to remind BBS users of the potential problems. They include: Proportion of range in the survey area-All BBS analyses incorporate data only from BBS routes. Analysis of survey data cannot tell us the proportion of the individuals in a species that breed outside the range of the survey. Species that are recorded only on the margins of the surveyed area are often of low sample size or variable, but many species (e.g., Canada Goose) may have substantial populations within the survey area. Trends are always specific to the areas surveyed. Roadside biases-The BBS is a roadside survey, and a major criticism of the survey has been that habitat changes along roadsides may not be representative of regional habitat changes. Trends from the BBS may therefore reflect only populations along roads rather than regional bird population changes. Habitat biases-Within the range of the BBS, many habitats are not well covered, and species that specialize in those habitats are poorly sampled. Wetland birds and species occupying alpine tundra habitats are examples of groups thought to be poorly represented in the survey. Even with all of the sampling and other biases discussed above, the BBS represents a unique attempt at a survey of breeding populations of birds in North America. Enormous amounts of data have been collected that provide the only information on regional population trends and breeding distributions of birds. The challenge for the future is to maintain and augment survey effort, and to identify and minimize deficiencies in the survey.dnot-applicableeContinental U.S., Canada, & Alaska, with spotty coverage in Alaska and northern half of Canada.   eAfter experimental surveys were conducted in Maryland and Delaware in 1965, the BBS has expanded to cover the continental United States and southern Canada. The survey was initiated in different years in different parts of its range. BBS routes were run only on routes in the United States east of the Mississippi River and in Quebec and the maritime provinces of Canada in 1966. In 1967, the BBS extended to the Central United States, with a few routes in Ontario and Manitoba. By 1968, all of the continental United States was covered, and routes were run across southern Canada. Routes in Alaska, Yukon, and Northwest Territories were added during the early 1980s.fRules of the survey indicate that observers should conduct surveys within +/- 0.1 mi. from the prescribed stop; stops may also be moved over time. Further, survey includes a 400m radius. Therefore, exact locations of birds surveyed should not be inferred within approximately 500 meters of a survey stop location.

Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).dCertain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch. The Soil Survey of Adams County, Pennsylvania is edgematched to the adjacent SSURGO certified Pennsylvania Soil Surveys of York County and Franklin County and the adjacent SSURGO certified Maryland Soil Surveys of Carroll County and Frederick County. Feature edges and descriptive attributes of this soil survey are matched to those in Franklin and York Counties. Soil delineations are matched to those in Carroll County, Maryland, but do not match descriptive attributes exactly. Feature labels do not match adjacent soil surveys exactly. The soil survey area boundaries match.eA map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified on the map is a delineation. Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas that have properties and behavior significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map. A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas (map unit components), each with a designated range in proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little or no recognizable soil. Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units, and location of special soil features. These standards are outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993, USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995, USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS. The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on data collected by scientists during the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and undifferentiated groups. Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting. Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist of two or more dissimilar components that occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether complex or association is used in the name. The major components of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In either case, because the major components are sufficiently different in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association, each major component is normally present though their proportions may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent. Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two or more components that are not consistently associated geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in the same map delineation. These components are included in the same named map unit because their use and management are the same or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations. Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend, one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per 3,000 acres. A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about 5 acres.fThe accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000 feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units. For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very narrow.   fSoil delineation boundaries and special soil features generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.  aDataGateway-nrcs-usda-gov.  cSpecial Soil Features CodesdSpecial Soil Features labels represent specific Special Soil Features.

The primary limiting factor for the level of detail of the source is the scale of the source materials. The proper selection of grid spacing determines the level of content that may be extracted from a given source during digitization.dThe fidelity of the relationships encoded in the data structure of the DEM are automatically verified using a USGS software program upon completion of the data production cycle. The test verifies full compliance to the DEM specification.eThe DEM is visually inspected for completeness on a DEM view and edit system for the purpose of performing a final quality control and if necessary edit of the DEM. The physical format of each digital elevation model is validated for content completeness and logical consistency during production quality control and prior to archiving in the National Digital Cartographic Data Base. Due to the variable orientation of the quadrilateral in relation to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection grid, profiles that pass within the bounds of the DEM quadrilateral, may be void of elevation grid points, and are not represented in the DEM. This condition occurs infrequently and is always the first or last profile of the dataset. Level 2 DEM: Level 2 DEM's may contain void areas due to interruptions to contours in the source graphic or DLG. Void area elevation grid posts are assigned the value of -32,767. In addition, suspect elevation areas may exist in the DEM but are not specifically identified. Suspect areas can be located on the source graphic as a "disturbed surface, " symbolized by contours overprinted with photorevised or other surface patterns.fThe horizontal accuracy of the DEM is expressed as an estimated root mean square error (RMSE). The estimate of the RMSE is based upon horizontal accuracy tests of the DEM source materials which are selected as equal to or less than intended horizontal RMSE error of the DEM. The testing of horizontal accuracy of the source materials isaccomplished by comparing the planimetric (X and Y) coordinates of well-defined ground points with the coordinates of the same points as determined from a source of higher accuracy.iThe vertical RMSE statistic is used to describe the vertical accuracy of a DEM, encompassing both random and systematic errors introduced during production of the data. The RMSE is encoded in element number 5 of record C of the DEM. Accuracy is computed by a comparison of linear interpolated elevations in the DEM with corresponding known elevations. Test points are well distributed, representative of the terrain, and have true elevations with accuracies well within the DEM accuracy criteria. Acceptable test points include, in order of preference: field control, aerotriangulated test points, spot elevations, or points on contours from existing source maps with appropriate contour interval. A minimum of 28 test points per DEM is required to compute the RMSE, which is composed of a single test using 20 interior points and 8 edge points. Edge points are those which are located along, at, or near the quadrangle neatlines and are deemed by the editor to be useful to evaluating the accuracy of the edge of the DEM. Collection of test point data and comparison of the DEM with the quadrangle hypsography are conducted by the quality control units within the USGS. There are three types of DEM vertical errors; blunder, systematic and random. These errors are reduced in magnitude by editing but cannot be completely eliminated. Blunder errors are those errors of major proportions and are easily identified and removed during interactive editing. Systematic errors are those errors that follow some fixed pattern and are introduced by data collection procedures and systems. These error artifacts include: vertical elevation shifts, misinterpretation of terrain surface due to trees, buildings and shadows, and fictitious ridges, tops, benches or striations. Random errors result from unknown or accidental causes. DEM's are edited to correctly depict elevation surfaces that correspond to water bodies of specified size. Level 1 DEM: A RMSE of 7-meters or less is the desired accuracy standard. A RMSE of 15-meters is the maximum permitted. A 7.5-minute DEM at this level has an absolute elevation error tolerance of 50 meters (approximately three times the 15-meter RMSE) for blunder errors for any grid node when compared to the true elevation. Any array of points in the DEM can not encompass more than 49 contiguous elevations in error by more than 21 meters (three times the 7-meter RMSE). Systematic errors that are within stated accuracy standards are tolerated. Level 2 DEM: A vertical RMSE of one-half of the contour interval, determined by the source map, is the maximum permitted. Systematic errors may not exceed one contour interval, determined by the source map, is the maximum permitted. Systematic errors may not exceed one contour interval specified by the source graphic. Level 2 DEMs have been processed or smoothed for consistency and edited to remove identifiable systematic errors.  adem10meter.  pU.S.Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Digital Elevation Models -- Data Users Guide; Reston, VA, A hypertext extract is available at: URL: http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/glis/hyper/guide/usgs_dem Softcopies in ASCII and WordPerfect format are available at: URL: ftp://mapping.usgs.gov/pub/ti/DEM/ U.S.Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1992, Standards for digital elevation models: Reston, VA, Softcopies in ASCII and WordPerfect format are available at: URL: ftp://mapping.usgs.gov/pub/ti/DEM/ 7aDEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital elevation model.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aelevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital terrain model.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ahypsography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaltitude.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aAbbottstown Quadrangle.2none 7aPennsylvania.2none40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/07054nem a2200337Ia 4500008004100000034004000041037001600081100002700097245007400124255008000198260004500278270001800323310001400341342015900355343001100514352001100525500002200536506001000558514520400568520001605772552052805788650003706316650005706353650004306410650005506453650004506508650004206553651003406595651002406629856006306653040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-80.5194e-74.696f42.2695g39.7199  cnonegDEM, 10aU.S. Geological Survey10a7.5 minute digital elevation models (DEM) for Pennsylvania (30 meter)  c(-80.5194 -- -74.696/42.2695 -- 39.7199).d(Universal Transverse Mercator).  aReston, VirginiabU.S. Geological Survey  mpasda@psu.edu  cIrregular  aNational Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929bReleased by USGS in either meters or feett1uExplicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates  bmeters  araster  aground condition.  anone.  aThe accuracy of a DEM is dependent upon the level of detail of the source and the grid spacing used to sample that source.

Test points are well distributed, representative of the terrain, and have true elevations with accuracies well within the DEM accuracy criteria. Acceptable test points include, in order of preference: field control, aerotriangulated test points, spot elevations, or points on contours from existing source maps with appropriate contour interval. A minimum of 28 test points per DEM is required to compute the RMSE, which is composed of a single test using 20 interior points and 8 edge points. Edge points are those which are located along, at, or near the quadrangle neatlines and are deemed by the editor to be useful to evaluating the accuracy of the edge of the DEM. Collection of test point data and comparison of the DEM with the quadrangle hypsography are conducted by the quality control units within the USGS. There are three types of DEM vertical errors; blunder, systematic and random. These errors are reduced in magnitude by editing but cannot be completely eliminated. Blunder errors are those errors of major proportions and are easily identified and removed during interactive editing. Systematic errors are those errors that follow some fixed pattern and are introduced by data collection procedures and systems. These error artifacts include: vertical elevation shifts, misinterpretation of terrain surface due to trees, buildings and shadows, and fictitious ridges, tops, benches or striations. Random errors result from unknown or accidental causes. DEM's are edited to correctly depict elevation surfaces that correspond to water bodies of specified size. Level 1 DEM: A RMSE of 7-meters or less is the desired accuracy standard. A RMSE of 15-meters is the maximum permitted. A 7.5-minute DEM at this level has an absolute elevation error tolerance of 50 meters (approximately three times the 15-meter RMSE) for blunder errors for any grid node when compared to the true elevation. Any array of points in the DEM can not encompass more than 49 contiguous elevations in error by more than 21 meters (three times the 7-meter RMSE). Systematic errors that are within stated accuracy standards are tolerated. Level 2 DEM: A vertical RMSE of one-half of the contour interval, determined by the source map, is the maximum permitted. Systematic errors may not exceed one contour interval, determined by the source map, is the maximum permitted. Systematic errors may not exceed one contour interval specified by the source graphic. Level 2 DEMs have been processed or smoothed for consistency and edited to remove identifiable systematic errors.  adem30meter_DC.  pU.S.Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Digital Elevation Models -- Data Users Guide; Reston, VA, A hypertext extract is available at: URL: http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/glis/hyper/guide/usgs_dem Softcopies in ASCII and WordPerfect format are available at: URL: ftp://mapping.usgs.gov/pub/ti/DEM/ U.S.Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1992, Standards for digital elevation models: Reston, VA, Softcopies in ASCII and WordPerfect format are available at: URL: ftp://mapping.usgs.gov/pub/ti/DEM/ 7aDEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital elevation model.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aelevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital terrain model.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ahypsography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaltitude.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDistrict of Columbia.2none40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu07196nem a2200337Ia 4500008004100000034005100041037001600092100002700108245007000135255009100205260004500296270011900341310001400460342015900474343001100633352001100644500002200655506001000677514520400687520001905891552052805910650003706438650005706475650004306532650005506575650004506630650004206675650005906717651002006776856006206796040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-83.781947 e-75.134618f39.496607 g36.412297  cnonegDEM, 10aU.S. Geological Survey10a7.5 minute digital elevation models (DEM) for Virginia (30 meter)  c(-83.781947  -- -75.134618/39.496607  -- 36.412297).d(Universal Transverse Mercator).  aReston, VirginiabU.S. Geological Survey  a115 Land and Water buildingbUniversity ParkcPennsylvaniadUnited Statese16802k(814) 865 - 8792mjfs126@psu.edu  cIrregular  aNational Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929bReleased by USGS in either meters or feett1uExplicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates  bmeters  araster  aground condition.  anone.  aThe accuracy of a DEM is dependent upon the level of detail of the source and the grid spacing used to sample that source.

The data set field content of each DOQ header record element is validated to assure completeness prior to archiving in the NDCDB.fThe DOQ horizontal positional accuracy and the assurance of that accuracy depend, in part, on the accuracy of the data inputs to the rectification process. These inputs consist of the digital elevation model (DEM),aerotriangulation control and methods, the photo source camera calibration, scanner calibration, and aerial photographs that meet National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) standards. The vertical accuracy of the verified USGS format DEM is equivalent to or better than a USGS level 1 or 2 DEM, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of no greater than 7.0 meters.

Analog dodging consists of holding back light from certain areas of the sensitized photographic material to avoid overexposure. The diapositive is inspected to insure clarity and radiometric uniformity. Diapositive image brightness values are collected with a minimum of image quality manipulation. Image brightness values may deviate from brightness values of the original imagery due to image value interpolation during the scanning and rectification processes. Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto quadrangle with the original unrectified image to determine if the digital orthophoto has the same or better image quality as the original unrectified input image. Slight systematic radiometric differences can be detected between adjacent DOQ files due primarily to differences in source photography capture dates and sun angles of aerial photography along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when compared to adjacent DOQ file coverages.dAll DOQ header data and image file sizes are validated by the Tape Validation System (TVS) software prior to archiving in the National Digital Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB). This validation procedure assures correct physical format and field values for header record elements. Logical relationships between header record elements are tested.eAll DOQ imagery is visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps, or image misplacement exist in the 3.75' image area or in overedge coverage. DOQ images may be derived by mosaicking multiple images, in order to insure complete coverage. All DOQ's are cloud free within the 3.75' image area. Some clouds may, very infrequently, be encountered only in the overedge coverage. Source photography is leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Void areas having a radiometric value of zero and appearing black may exist. These are areas for which no photographic source is available or result from image transformation from other planimetric systems to the universal transverse mercator (UTM). In the latter case, the void sliver areas are on the outside edges of the overedge area. The data set field content of each DOQ header record element is validated to assure completeness prior to archiving in the NDCDB.fThe DOQ horizontal positional accuracy and the assurance of that accuracy depend, in part, on the accuracy of the data inputs to the rectification process.

Also, the quality of the user's monitor affects the DRG color displayed. Although the DRG generally contains the complete content of the source map, features may occasionally be blurred because of substandard source materials. The DRG also may contain misclassified pixels (color noise). The DRG is an 8-bit color image that employs a color palette to ensure uniform colors throughout a particular DRG series. All DRG's within a series must have the same RGB value.dThe USGS DRG is produced with the intention of replicating as close as possible the original source map. Users of the DRG will note, however, that a certain amount of "noise" can be discerned when small areas are blown up or viewed under zoomed-in conditions. This noise is in the form of random specks or pixels of color and halos due to any number of factors, such as, the quality of the source, the use of screens and patterns on the litho, and the unevenness of ink due to saturation and absorption. Discontinuities or breaks in linear features may also be present and are due to improper calibration or usage of the scanner, the condition of the source, and resampling. Descreening, quantizing, and noise filtering are methods used to reduce noise, which, besides creating a more aesthetically pleasing image, have the added benefit of reducing the size of the image file. Removal of lithographic screen patterns is preferred but not required.eImage completeness is checked by visually inspecting a sampling of DRG's. Each selected DRG will be examined for gaps (missing data) in the main body of the map, the map collar, the overedge areas, and any insetsfDRG's will retain the horizontal accuracy of the source maps. Most USGS printed maps contain the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) note in the collar area. The NMAS states that for maps on publication scales of 1:20,000 or smaller, not more than 10 percent of the points tested shall be in error by more than 1/50 inch measured on the publication scale. Test points must be "well-defined", that is, easily visible or recoverable on the ground. For DRG's this accuracy statement applies only to that area of the DRG that falls within the neatline of the source map (excluding inset areas). Overedge areas falling outside the transformation boundary area (the map neatline), can exhibit anomalies or discrepancies. These anomalies also will appear in the map inset areas and in the map collar. For maps without the NMAS note, the horizontal accuracy is unknown. However, the DRG will retain the accuracy of the source map.  adrg24kcalbers.  pStandards for Digital Raster Graphic 7adigital raster graphic.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adrg.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic quadrangle.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7araster image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aPennsylvania.2none 7aAbbottstown Quadrangle.2none40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu04236nem a2200313Ia 4500008004100000034004000041037012300081100002700204245007500231255008000306260004500386270001800431310001400449343001100463352001800474500002200492506001000514514294900524520001903473552004103492650005603533650003703589650005603626650004903682650004603731650005903777651002403836856006203860040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-80.5194e-74.696f42.2695g39.7199  cFrom USGS: $32 for each cd-rom.

The RGB values for a particular color, therefore, will remain consistent throughout that DRG series. Although the color values of the DRG may sometimes match those of the paper source map, a user will usually notice small differences between the colors on the digital image and on the paper map. Also, the quality of the user's monitor affects the DRG color displayed. Although the DRG generally contains the complete content of the source map, features may occasionally be blurred because of substandard source materials. The DRG also may contain misclassified pixels (color noise). The DRG is an 8-bit color image that employs a color palette to ensure uniform colors throughout a particular DRG series. All DRG's within a series must have the same RGB value.dThe USGS DRG is produced with the intention of replicating as close as possible the original source map. Users of the DRG will note, however, that a certain amount of "noise" can be discerned when small areas are blown up or viewed under zoomed-in conditions. This noise is in the form of random specks or pixels of color and halos due to any number of factors, such as, the quality of the source, the use of screens and patterns on the litho, and the unevenness of ink due to saturation and absorption. Discontinuities or breaks in linear features may also be present and are due to improper calibration or usage of the scanner, the condition of the source, and resampling. Descreening, quantizing, and noise filtering are methods used to reduce noise, which, besides creating a more aesthetically pleasing image, have the added benefit of reducing the size of the image file. Removal of lithographic screen patterns is preferred but not required.eImage completeness is checked by visually inspecting a sampling of DRG's. Each selected DRG will be examined for gaps (missing data) in the main body of the map, the map collar, the overedge areas, and any insetsfDRG's will retain the horizontal accuracy of the source maps. Most USGS printed maps contain the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) note in the collar area. The NMAS states that for maps on publication scales of 1:20,000 or smaller, not more than 10 percent of the points tested shall be in error by more than 1/50 inch measured on the publication scale. Test points must be "well-defined", that is, easily visible or recoverable on the ground. For DRG's this accuracy statement applies only to that area of the DRG that falls within the neatline of the source map (excluding inset areas). Overedge areas falling outside the transformation boundary area (the map neatline), can exhibit anomalies or discrepancies. These anomalies also will appear in the map inset areas and in the map collar. For maps without the NMAS note, the horizontal accuracy is unknown. However, the DRG will retain the accuracy of the source map.  adrg250k_WV.  pStandards for Digital Raster Graphic 7adigital raster graphic.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adrg.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic quadrangle.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7araster image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aWest Virginia.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/03567nem a2200409Ia 4500008004100000034003700041100004900078245003900127255006800166260003200234270009500266310001200361342002800373342007100401343001600472352001100488500002200499506002400521514209900545520003602644552017002680650001402850650002602864650002402890650001502914650002102929650002002950650001302970650003102983651001803014651001803032651001803050651002003068651002103088651002303109651002503132040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-76.137e-74.772f40.677g39.77210aDelaware Valley Regional Planning Commission10aDVRPC's 2005 Topographic Contours.  bLambert Conformal Conicc(-76.137 -- -74.772/40.677 -- 39.772).  aMt.

Please see the "Survey Accuracy Requirements" and "Field Methodology" sections in the Survey Report for more information. Elevations from the unclassified lidar surface were measured for the x,y location of each check point. Elevations interpolated from the unclassified lidar surface were then compared to the elevation values of the surveyed control. The RMSEz was computed to be 0.04 meters and AccuracyZ to be 0.085 meters. This meets the required AccuracyZ value of 19.6 cm raw NVA at 95 percent confidence level using (RMSEz * 1.9600) as defined by the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA); assessed and reported using National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP)/ASPRS Guidelines.  aDVRPC_LiDAR_2015.  aMicroStation Version 8; TerraScan Version 15; TerraModeler Version 15; GeoCue Version 2014.1.21.1; ESRI ArcGIS 10.2; Global Mapper 16; Leica Cloud Pro 1.2; Windows 7 Operating System \\psihq_nx3200\Projects\26236_DVRPC_LiDAR\ 24.1 GB and \\Matrix\LIDAR\26236_DVRPC\ 5.09 TB.  aNone. 0aElevation data. 0aLidar. 0aHydrology. 0aDelaware Valley. 0aNew Jersey. 0aBurlington County. 0aCamden County. 0aGloucester County. 0aMercer County. 0aPennsylvania. 0aBucks County. 0aDelaware County. 0aMercer County. 0aPhiladelphia Coutny.05482nem a2200613Ia 4500008004100000034004100041100004900082245005000131255007200181260003200253270011800285310001200403342002800415343001600443352001100459500002200470506002400492514287100516520001503387552017003402650004603572650005003618650005203668650004903720650005103769650004403820650004403864650004603908650005403954650005204008650005404060650005404114650004904168650004104217650003904258650004004297650004104337650005904378650005904437651001804496651001804514651002004532651002104552651002304573651002504596651001804621651001804639651002004657651002104677651002304698651002504721856005904746856006304805040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d -76.137e -74.772f 40.677g 39.77210aDelaware Valley Regional Planning Commission10aDVRPC 2010 Digital Orthoimagery - TIFF Tiles.  bLambert Conformal Conicc( -76.137 --  -74.772/ 40.677 --  39.772).  aMt.

The residuals of the final adjustment ensured compliance with NSSDA standards. The Pre Adjustment Gross Error Detection Statistical Test (Data Snooping, with a confidence level of 99.9%) has been applied to all observations included in the aerial triangulations. To detect small gross errors, during Adjustment Robust Estimators were used with the same confidence level and a power of the test of 1-beta=0.2. Systematic errors were eliminated through self calibration and through Additional Parameters. Their numerical stability, statistical significance, internal and external reliability were checked using Student-t test with the same confidence level and Variance/Co-variance analysis. Finally, the arrived variance factor was submitted to a Chi-square test against the pre-adjustment variance factor using a confidence level 99.9%. Evaluation of the DEM includes checking the terrain data for spikes and wells, omissions, and other anomalies that do not meet the project accuracy requirements. The horizontal and vertical accuracy has been tested by comparing the coordinates of well-defined points in the dataset with coordinates of the same points from an independent source of higher accuracy. The program ORTHOQC is able to match the original image pixels of pass/tie points, ground control points, and check points with the final ortho, extract the corresponding horizontal coordinates from the digital ortho and compare them with the original measured points in the field or adjusted from the aerotriangulation. Values of statistics such as RMSE, Max and Min Discrepancies, standard deviation, etc. are then derived and analyzed statistically.dAll files are inspected by the Production Manager to ensure that they conform to the specified file naming conventions, all files load in their correct geographic position when loaded using the ASCII file header, all files conform to the project specifications for pixel resolution, file standard, dimensions, and compression, and all files do not contain blemishes such as visible seam lines, tone differences, data dropout or artifacts; scan swathing, or warped bridges and overpasses.eAll imagery is visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacement exists in the image area. Imagery is mosaicked to ensure complete coverage for map sheets. The imagery has been checked to ensure that the boundary and the content has been covered in its entirety.fThe horizontal accuracy standard follows the NSSDA-1998 standard. The maximum permissible RMSE for 95% of the horizontal check points for the mapping product is 5 feet or better.iThe DEM data meets the required vertical accuracy necessary to ensure that the horizontal accuracies of the orthophotos are met.  aDVRPC2010.  pWhere applicable, all data conforms to the Proposal for 2005 Aerial Photography Project presented to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission August 5, 2004. 7aorthoimagery.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophotography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial photography.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophotograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial photograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial photo.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital orthoimagery.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital aerial photo.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified photograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimagery.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aortho.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aaerial.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDTM/DEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aDVRPC Region. 0aBucks County. 0aChester County. 0aDelaware County. 0aMontgomery County. 0aPhiladelphia County. 0aPennsylvania. 0aBucks County. 0aChester County. 0aDelaware County. 0aMontgomery County. 0aPhiladelphia County.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.dvrpc.org/40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/05326nem a2200553Ia 4500008004100000034004100041100004900082245006500131255007200196260003200268270009500300310001200395342002800407343001600435352001100451500002200462506002400484514287100508520003403379552017003413650004603583650005003629650005203679650004903731650005103780650004403831650004403875650004603919650005403965650005204019650005404071650005404125650004904179650004104228650003904269650004004308650004104348650005904389650005904448651001804507651001804525651001804543651002004561651002104581651002304602651002504625856005904650856006304709040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d -76.137e -74.772f 40.677g 39.77210aDelaware Valley Regional Planning Commission10aDVRPC 2005 Digital Orthoimagery - Bucks North Mr.SID Mosaic.  bLambert Conformal Conicc( -76.137 --  -74.772/ 40.677 --  39.772).  aMt.

The NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed. To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS reports that accompany the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL. Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information. Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management. The 1-percent-annual-chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in the FIS report.dWhen FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.eData contained in the NFHL reflects the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are studied. Note: The NFHL reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. Currently, not all areas of a State or Territory have effective FIRM Database data. As a result, users may need to refer to the effective FIRM for effective flood hazard information.fThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Horizontal accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system.

Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. The reliability of the floodplain boundary delineation is quantified by comparing the computed flood elevation to the ground elevation at the mapped floodplain boundary. The tolerance for how precisely the flood elevation and the ground elevation must match varies based on the flood risk class, which is a function of population, population density, and/or anticipated growth in floodplain areas. A horizontal accuracy of +/- 38 feet is used to determine the compliance with the vertical tolerances defined for each risk class. The range of differences between the ground elevation (defined from the topographic data used for the Flood Risk Project) and the computed flood elevation is between +/- 1.0 foot at the 95% confidence interval for areas with high population within the floodplain and/or high anticipated growth and Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk to +/- one-half the contour interval at the 85% confidence interval for areas with low population and densities within the floodplain and small or no anticipated growth and SFHAs with low flood risk.

Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are studied. Note: The NFHL reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. Currently, not all areas of a State or Territory have effective FIRM Database data. As a result, users may need to refer to the effective FIRM for effective flood hazard information.fThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Horizontal accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed.iThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM.

Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. The reliability of the floodplain boundary delineation is quantified by comparing the computed flood elevation to the ground elevation at the mapped floodplain boundary. The tolerance for how precisely the flood elevation and the ground elevation must match varies based on the flood risk class, which is a function of population, population density, and/or anticipated growth in floodplain areas. A horizontal accuracy of +/- 38 feet is used to determine the compliance with the vertical tolerances defined for each risk class. The range of differences between the ground elevation (defined from the topographic data used for the Flood Risk Project) and the computed flood elevation is between +/- 1.0 foot at the 95% confidence interval for areas with high population within the floodplain and/or high anticipated growth and Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk to +/- one-half the contour interval at the 85% confidence interval for areas with low population and densities within the floodplain and small or no anticipated growth and SFHAs with low flood risk.

The NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions.

Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed. To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS reports that accompany the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL. Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information. Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management. The 1-percent-annual-chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in the FIS report.dWhen FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.eData contained in the NFHL reflects the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are studied. Note: The NFHL reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. Currently, not all areas of a State or Territory have effective FIRM Database data. As a result, users may need to refer to the effective FIRM for effective flood hazard information.fThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM.

The range of differences between the ground elevation (defined from the topographic data used for the Flood Risk Project) and the computed flood elevation is between +/- 1.0 foot at the 95% confidence interval for areas with high population within the floodplain and/or high anticipated growth and Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk to +/- one-half the contour interval at the 85% confidence interval for areas with low population and densities within the floodplain and small or no anticipated growth and SFHAs with low flood risk. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed.  aFEMA_NFHL_54_WV_20161030.  aOriginal data development environment may vary.

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages.

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages.

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.dAll GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived. This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements. Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. Seamline mismatches are corrected unless the overall displacement is less than one pixel.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free.

This is due to the fact that images downloaded from the collection as jpegs had a 16 million color resolution, and after being combined, were reduced by an optimal best match method to 256 color (8 bit) depth.dGreat care was taken by eye to seam together the four separate jpeg images that were scanned for each topographic map at library sites. Because of small levels of inaccuracy due to image rotation or scanner operation, there are varying amounts of error at seams where the images line up.

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_BereaSandstoneAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3000.  cOIL_F50d50% probability of greater than this volume of undiscovered oil in the assessment unit (in millions of barrels), USGS DDS-60, Chpt.

For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_BereaSandstoneQuarterMileCells.  aARC/INFO version 8.2.

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_CatskillSandstonesSiltstonesAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600)

For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_CatskillSandstonesSiltstonesAssessmentUnitQuarterMileCells.

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_DevonianSiltstoneShaleAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600)

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit.

For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_GreenbrierLimestoneAssessmentUnitQuarterMileCells.  aARC/INFO

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_MarcellusShaleAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack

For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_MarcellusShaleAssessmentUnitQuarterMileCells.  aARC/INFO version

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_MississippianSandstonesAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600)

For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_MississippianSandstonesAssessmentUnitQuarterMileCells.

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_NorthwesternOhioShaleAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600)

For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_NorthwesternOhioShaleAssessmentUnitQuarterMileCells.  aARC/INFO

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_OriskanySandstoneStratigraphicAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build

For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_OriskanySandstoneStratigraphicAssessmentUnitQuarterMileCells.

The first digit of the code indicates the World region number (5), the following three digits (067) are the North America province number, the following two digits (5067xx) are the Total Petroleum System number, and the last two digits (506701xx) are the Assessment Unit number of that particular Total Petroleum System. The assessment results attributes have been rounded to two decimal places. For more detailed assessment results data, refer to the tabular information for the Appalachian Basin Province that is available at NOGA Online (the URL is listed in the Online Linkage). The fractile estimates for the largest oil or gas accumulations are calculated for conventional accumulations and are defined as character fields because they may be blank (not zero) if the accumulation is less than the minumum undiscovered field size used in the assessment. Assessment units that contain no assessment results attributes are those that were not quantitatively assessed.dThe Assessment Unit boundary was defined on the basis of the surface and subsurface geology of the petroleum system elements, and oil and gas production, shows, and seeps related to the Assessment Unit. The province geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each Assessment Unit in a formal geologic and petroleum system review meeting.eThe Assessment Unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS data base for wells (1999 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (1999 update).fThe Assessment Unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the Total Petroleum System. The Assessment Unit boundary was mapped on a 1:2,000,000-scale hard copy base map by the province geologist and the boundary line digitally transferred using Arcedit. The Assessment Unit boundary lines are not intended for use at a scale greater than 1:2,000,000.  aNAOGP_OriskanySandstoneStructuralAssessmentUnit.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600)

Biewick, S. Weiler and C.C. Skinner, depends upon the accuracy of the oil and gas well information in the 2001 version of the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data. For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.eThe cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.fA visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. In particular, the values of latitude and longitude for the wells in PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were assumed to be accurate.  aNAOGP_OriskanySandstoneStructuralQuarterMileCells.  aARC/INFO version

Accuracy will be determined and reported using the methodology specified in the FGDC National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy. Until an independent overall assessment of the accuracy of NED is completed, it is best to refer to published information on the accuracy of the source digital elevation models (DEM's) from which NED was assembled. The primary source data were the USGS 7.5-minute (30-meter or 10-meter resolution) DEM's. Gaps in the 7.5-minute DEM coverage were filled with data from USGS 30-minute (2-arc-second resolution) or 1-degree (3-arc-second resolution) DEM's. The USGS Data Users Guide 5 for DEM's (traditionally known as the "blue book"), last published in 1993, contains a general discussion of DEM accuracy and a brief description of the accuracy testing methodology. The DEM data users guide also describes the classification levels of standard USGS DEM products. The level of a DEM is defined, in part, on the basis of its accuracy. 10NED sources for Pennsylvania 30-meter and 10-meter resolution DEM data, 10-meter data was resampled to 30-meter resolution for assembly of the nationwide dataset.  aned_10meter_quads. 7a7.5-MINUTE DEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aCARTOGRAPHY.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDIGITAL MAPPING.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aEARTH SCIENCE.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aEDC.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aEROS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aGEODATA.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aGIS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aLAND SURFACE.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aLANDFORMS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aMAPPING.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aRASTER.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aTERRAIN ELEVATION.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aTOPOGRAPHY.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aUSGS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aElevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aPennsylvania.2GCMD Location Keywords40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://seamless.usgs.gov/40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu03153nem a2200445Ia 4500008004100000034004900041037001600090100003400106245008400140255005500224260006100279270009400340310001400434352001100448500002200459506001000481514124700491520002001738650004801758650004501806650003701851650005701888650004901945650004701994650003702041650003802078650004102116650003702157650004602194650004302240650004102283650004002324650005102364650004402415650003802459650004302497651004202540856006302582856006202645040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-77.471603e-76.958397f40.069698g39.719891  cnonegDEM, 10aU.S. Geological Survey (USGS)10aNational Elevation Dataset 10 Meter 7.5x7.5 minute quadrangle for Pennsylvania.  c(-77.471603 -- -76.958397/40.069698 -- 39.719891).  aFort Worth, TXbNational Cartography & Geospatial Center  a115 Land and Water BuildingbUniversity ParkcPAdUSAe16802k814-865-8792mpasda@psu.edu  cAs needed  aRaster  apublication date.  aNone.  fA plan for assessing the overall accuracy of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) based on independent high-accuracy geodetic control is currently under development.

The accuracy described will be in the terms used in the FGDC Content Standards for Framework Land Elevation Data . Accuracy will be determined and reported using the methodology specified in the FGDC National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy. Until an independent overall assessment of the accuracy of NED is completed, it is best to refer to published information on the accuracy of the source digital elevation models (DEM's) from which NED was assembled. The primary source data were the USGS 7.5-minute (30-meter or 10-meter resolution) DEM's. Gaps in the 7.5-minute DEM coverage were filled with data from USGS 30-minute (2-arc-second resolution) or 1-degree (3-arc-second resolution) DEM's.

The NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed. To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS reports that accompany the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL. Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information. Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management. The 1-percent-annual-chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in the FIS report.dWhen FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.eData contained in the NFHL reflects the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are studied. Note: The NFHL reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. Currently, not all areas of a State or Territory have effective FIRM Database data. As a result, users may need to refer to the effective FIRM for effective flood hazard information.fThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Horizontal accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed.iThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM.

Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. The reliability of the floodplain boundary delineation is quantified by comparing the computed flood elevation to the ground elevation at the mapped floodplain boundary. The tolerance for how precisely the flood elevation and the ground elevation must match varies based on the flood risk class, which is a function of population, population density, and/or anticipated growth in floodplain areas. A horizontal accuracy of +/- 38 feet is used to determine the compliance with the vertical tolerances defined for each risk class. The range of differences between the ground elevation (defined from the topographic data used for the Flood Risk Project) and the computed flood elevation is between +/- 1.0 foot at the 95% confidence interval for areas with high population within the floodplain and/or high anticipated growth and Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk to +/- one-half the contour interval at the 85% confidence interval for areas with low population and densities within the floodplain and small or no anticipated growth and SFHAs with low flood risk.

The NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed. To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS reports that accompany the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL. Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information. Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management. The 1-percent-annual-chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in the FIS report.dWhen FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.eData contained in the NFHL reflects the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are studied. Note: The NFHL reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. Currently, not all areas of a State or Territory have effective FIRM Database data. As a result, users may need to refer to the effective FIRM for effective flood hazard information.fThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM.

Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. The reliability of the floodplain boundary delineation is quantified by comparing the computed flood elevation to the ground elevation at the mapped floodplain boundary. The tolerance for how precisely the flood elevation and the ground elevation must match varies based on the flood risk class, which is a function of population, population density, and/or anticipated growth in floodplain areas. A horizontal accuracy of +/- 38 feet is used to determine the compliance with the vertical tolerances defined for each risk class. The range of differences between the ground elevation (defined from the topographic data used for the Flood Risk Project) and the computed flood elevation is between +/- 1.0 foot at the 95% confidence interval for areas with high population within the floodplain and/or high anticipated growth and Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk to +/- one-half the contour interval at the 85% confidence interval for areas with low population and densities within the floodplain and small or no anticipated growth and SFHAs with low flood risk.

The NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed. To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS reports that accompany the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL. Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information. Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management. The 1-percent-annual-chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in the FIS report.dWhen FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.eData contained in the NFHL reflects the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are studied. Note: The NFHL reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. Currently, not all areas of a State or Territory have effective FIRM Database data. As a result, users may need to refer to the effective FIRM for effective flood hazard information.fThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Horizontal accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed.iThe NFHL consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM.

Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. The reliability of the floodplain boundary delineation is quantified by comparing the computed flood elevation to the ground elevation at the mapped floodplain boundary. The tolerance for how precisely the flood elevation and the ground elevation must match varies based on the flood risk class, which is a function of population, population density, and/or anticipated growth in floodplain areas. A horizontal accuracy of +/- 38 feet is used to determine the compliance with the vertical tolerances defined for each risk class. The range of differences between the ground elevation (defined from the topographic data used for the Flood Risk Project) and the computed flood elevation is between +/- 1.0 foot at the 95% confidence interval for areas with high population within the floodplain and/or high anticipated growth and Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) with high flood risk to +/- one-half the contour interval at the 85% confidence interval for areas with low population and densities within the floodplain and small or no anticipated growth and SFHAs with low flood risk. Independent quality control testing of the individual FIRM Database components of the NFHL was also performed.  aNFHL_Pennsylvania2017.  aOriginal data development environment may vary.

As a part of the ISTAR workflow, the data from the color channels is edge sharpened using the nadir panchromatic channel. The orthophoto mosaics are inspected for accuracy issues that fall in the following categories: Aerotriangulation related DSM related Accuracy issues will be investigated through review and correction of the DSM or triangulation adjustment. Once the imagery has passed quality control review, final radiometric adjustments are performed to create a uniform overall appearance.dAll GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived. This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements. Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. Seamline mismatches are not corrected unless the overall displacement exceeds one meter.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free. Photography was flown during leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Coastal areas and international boundary regions may have areas without images (void areas) in parts of the coverage. These void areas have a radiometric value of either zero (black) or 128 (uniform gray).fCompliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data. Using several tools that are part of the ISTAR workflow, a digital surface model (DSM) was correlated at a post spacing of 2 meter depending on terrain and land cover. The ISTAR correlation algorithm computes the X,Y,Z value for each DSM post utilizing every stereo angle that is available. A series of DSM files were created for each acquisition block, one for each stereo look angle. A mosaic was then created from the separate DSM files where the best vertical value for each posting was selected from all look angles compared against the aerotriangulation adjustment which is incorporated into the mosaic. EarthData will then edit the surface to the level required to support the orthophoto production. An RMS value was determined by comparing the position of USGS ground test points to their photo-id'ed position in the rectified imagery. This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in meters. 0.40 The horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the accuracy of the aerotriangulation and digital surface model (DSM). For each rectified image (lift), an RMSE value for all of the standard errors of the tie/pass/control points located in that image (lift) and computed by the aerotriangulation solution was calculated. The DSM accuracy assessment was achieved by comparing the aerotriangulation-derived elevation with the elevation of the DSM. In addition, visual examination was employed to assess all tiles and its relative edge match. All results were examined for consistency and its compliance with the NSSDA accuracy standard.  aNGA_Mercer_pa2005.  aLeica ADS40 Digital Camera System ISTAR Digital Image Processing Software Z/I Imaging Orthopro 4.0 Windows NT/2000 Systems.  pU.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1996, Standards for Digital Orthophotos: Reston, VA. 7a0.3 meter orthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7anatural color orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimage map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aindex.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aTile Index.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aUS.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aMercer County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPA.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/06177nem a2200361Ia 4500008004100000034003300041100003400074245008400108255007300192270051000265310001400775343001100789500002200800500002600822506001000848514337900858520003304237538012804270552011404398650005404512650004904566650004404615650005804659650004404717650004304761650005904804650003904863650004404902651026504946651027605211651026505487856006305752040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-80.55e-79.99f41.50g41.0610aU.S. Geological Survey (USGS)10aTILE INDEX - USGS High Resolution Orthoimage for Mercer County, PA, Urban Area.  c(-80.55 -- -79.99/41.50 -- 41.06).d(Universal Transverse Mercator).  aEROS Data Center 47914 252nd StreetbSioux FallscSDdUSe57198-0001h1-605-594-6933k1-800-252-4547mcustserv@usgs.govrMonday through Friday 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM (Central Time)zThe above is the contact information for EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, SD.

These void areas have a radiometric value of either zero (black) or 128 (uniform gray)."f"The horizontal positional accuracy and the assurance of that accuracy depend, in part, on the accuracy of the data inputs to the rectification process. The location of existing USGS photoidentifiable ground control and contractor aerotriangulation points were evaluated on the Geotiff image and compared with their ground values in order to determine an overall accuracy for each test block of orthoimages within the project. After image coordinate measurement was completed for each block, an RMSE for the diagonal error was calculated for the orthoimages within the block. This value is an estimate of the horizontal accuracy of the tile expressed in meters." The relative accuracy is assembled by comparing rectified images generated from adjacent strips of imagery. The absolute accuracy is assessed by measuring the ground control points in the rectified image against the actual surveyed co-ordinate position. The testing is for overall accuracy.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which most often are the published USGS topographic quadrangle and/or the USDA Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Reaches codes are defined on all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, coastline, and connector. Waterbody reach codes are defined on all lake/pond and most reservoir features. Names were applied from the GNIS database. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Reaches codes are defined on all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, coastline, and connector. Waterbody reach codes are defined on all lake/pond and most reservoir features. Names were applied from the GNIS database. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which most often are the published USGS topographic quadrangle and/or the USDA Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Reaches codes are defined on all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, coastline, and connector. Waterbody reach codes are defined on all lake/pond and most reservoir features. Names were applied from the GNIS database. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which most often are the published USGS topographic quadrangle and/or the USDA Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which most often are the published USGS topographic quadrangle and/or the USDA Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Reaches codes are defined on all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, coastline, and connector. Waterbody reach codes are defined on all lake/pond and most reservoir features. Names were applied from the GNIS database. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which most often are the published USGS topographic quadrangle and/or the USDA Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which most often are the published USGS topographic quadrangle and/or the USDA Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Reaches codes are defined on all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, coastline, and connector. Waterbody reach codes are defined on all lake/pond and most reservoir features. Names were applied from the GNIS database. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.  aNHDH0502Monongahela_waterbody.  aMicrosoft Windows 2000 Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 8.3.0.800.  cOBJECTIDdInternal feature number., ESRIpThe names and definitions of all feature types, characteristics, and values are in U.S. Geological Survey, 1999, Standards for National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution: Reston, Virginia, U.S. Geological Survey.

Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.  aNHDH0503UprOhio_waterbody.  aMicrosoft Windows 2000 Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 8.3.0.800.  cOBJECTIDdInternal feature number., ESRIpThe names and definitions of all feature types, characteristics, and values are in U.S. Geological Survey, 1999, Standards for National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution: Reston, Virginia, U.S. Geological Survey.

Wetlands are shown in all of the conterminous 48 states and the District of Columbia. The accuracy of image interpretation depends on the quality of the imagery, the experience of the image analysts, the amount and quality of the collateral data, and the amount of ground truth verification work conducted. There is a margin error inherent in the use of imagery, thus detailed on-the-ground inspection of any particular site, may result in revision of the wetland boundaries or classification, established through image analysis. Wetlands or other mapped features may have changed since the date or the imagery and/or field work. There may be occasional differences in polygon boundaries or classifications between the information depicted on the map and the actual conditions on site.  aNWI_DE.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3000.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7aWetlands.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aDeepwater habitats.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aHydrography.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aSurface water.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aSwamps, marshes, bogs, fens.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 0aConterminous United States. 0aUnited States. 0aConterminous 48 states. 0aLower 48 states. 0aMaine. 0aVermont. 0aNew Hampshire. 0aConnecticut. 0aMassachusetts. 0aDelaware. 0aRhode Island. 0aNew York. 0aNew Jersey. 0aPennsylvania. 0aWest Virginia. 0aDistrict of Columbia. 0aVirginia. 0aMaryland. 0aOhio. 0aIndiana. 0aMichigan. 0aIllinois. 0aWisconsin. 0aIowa. 0aMissouri. 0aMinnesota. 0aKansas. 0aNebraska. 0aSouth Dakota. 0aNorth Dakota. 0aMontana. 0aColorado. 0aUtah. 0aWyoming. 0aTexas. 0aOklahoma. 0aNew Mexico. 0aArizona. 0aNevada. 0aCalifornia. 0aOregon. 0aWashington. 0aIdaho. 0aNorth Carolina. 0aSouth Carolina. 0aGeorgia. 0aAlabama. 0aFlorida. 0aMississippi. 0aLouisiana. 0aArkansas. 0aKentucky. 0aTennessee.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.fws.gov/wetlands/05019nem a2200985Ia 4500008004100000034004900041037019400090100003500284245004400319255008200363260009900445270007800544310002900622342003000651342008100681343001100762352001100773500008700784500002500871500008300896506001000979514135600989520001202345538009402357552004002451650012302491650013302614650012602747650012802873650014203001651003203143651001903175651002803194651002103222651001103243651001303254651001903267651001703286651001903303651001403322651001803336651001403354651001603368651001803384651001903402651002603421651001403447651001403461651001003475651001303485651001403498651001403512651001503526651001003541651001403551651001503565651001203580651001403592651001803606651001803624651001303642651001403655651001003669651001303679651001103692651001403703651001603717651001303733651001203746651001603758651001203774651001603786651001103802651002003813651002003833651001303853651001303866651001303879651001703892651001503909651001403924651001403938651001503952856006603967040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-80.391245e-71.681821f42.368286g34.597322  cThere is no charge for the online option.

The accuracy of image interpretation depends on the quality of the imagery, the experience of the image analysts, the amount and quality of the collateral data, and the amount of ground truth verification work conducted. There is a margin error inherent in the use of imagery, thus detailed on-the-ground inspection of any particular site, may result in revision of the wetland boundaries or classification, established through image analysis. Wetlands or other mapped features may have changed since the date or the imagery and/or field work. There may be occasional differences in polygon boundaries or classifications between the information depicted on the map and the actual conditions on site.  aNWI_MD.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3000.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7aWetlands.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aDeepwater habitats.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aHydrography.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aSurface water.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 7aSwamps, marshes, bogs, fens.2REQUIRED: Reference to a formally registered thesaurus or a similar authoritative source of theme keywords. 0aConterminous United States. 0aUnited States. 0aConterminous 48 states. 0aLower 48 states. 0aMaine. 0aVermont. 0aNew Hampshire. 0aConnecticut. 0aMassachusetts. 0aDelaware. 0aRhode Island. 0aNew York. 0aNew Jersey. 0aPennsylvania. 0aWest Virginia. 0aDistrict of Columbia. 0aVirginia. 0aMaryland. 0aOhio. 0aIndiana. 0aMichigan. 0aIllinois. 0aWisconsin. 0aIowa. 0aMissouri. 0aMinnesota. 0aKansas. 0aNebraska. 0aSouth Dakota. 0aNorth Dakota. 0aMontana. 0aColorado. 0aUtah. 0aWyoming. 0aTexas. 0aOklahoma. 0aNew Mexico. 0aArizona. 0aNevada. 0aCalifornia. 0aOregon. 0aWashington. 0aIdaho. 0aNorth Carolina. 0aSouth Carolina. 0aGeorgia. 0aAlabama. 0aFlorida. 0aMississippi. 0aLouisiana. 0aArkansas. 0aKentucky. 0aTennessee.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.fws.gov/wetlands/05025nem a2200985Ia 4500008004100000034005000041037019400091100003500285245004600320255008300366260009900449270007800548310002900626342003000655342008100685343001100766352001100777500008700788500002500875500008300900506001000983514135600993520001202349538009602361552004002457650012302497650013302620650012602753650012802879650014203007651003203149651001903181651002803200651002103228651001103249651001303260651001903273651001703292651001903309651001403328651001803342651001403360651001603374651001803390651001903408651002603427651001403453651001403467651001003481651001303491651001403504651001403518651001503532651001003547651001403557651001503571651001203586651001403598651001803612651001803630651001303648651001403661651001003675651001303685651001103698651001403709651001603723651001303739651001203752651001603764651001203780651001603792651001103808651002003819651002003839651001303859651001303872651001303885651001703898651001503915651001403930651001403944651001503958856006603973040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-127.982503e-65.272195f51.611788g22.725718  cThere is no charge for the online option.

Allegheny College visually compared assigned attributes against the published source map. Based on this review, the attributes are believed to be accurate.dComplete chain-node topology is present. The data set was checked for polygon closure, erroneous or duplicate arcs, incorrect intersections, overshoots and undershoots, label errors, and node errors.eThe data set represents regional surficial geology of northwestern Pennsylvania. Contacts between lithologic units and attributes have been assigned to represent the published glacial deposits map (Shepps et al., 1959). No changes or updates have been made in the compilation process.fThe horizontal positional accuracy of the data set is that of the 1959 "Map of the Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania", which was compiled and published at a scale of 1:125,000. The base map on which the 1959 map was compiled was derived from U.S. Geologic Survey topographic quadrangles.

Multiple GPS base stations were also running in the project area and were recording data at 1 Hz. The airborne GPS data was post-processed in DGPS mode together with base station data to provide high accuracy aircraft positions. The GPS trajectory then was combined with the IMU data using loosely coupled approach to yield high accuracy aircraft positions and attitude angles. Then the LiDAR data was processed using the aircraft trajectory and raw LiDAR data.dCompliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the collection of ground control and the establishment of a GPS base station at the operation airport as well as multiple other active stations in the project area.eThe DEM raster files cover the entire project delivery boundary. The pixels fall that outside the project delivery boundary are set to Void with a unique (3z(BNODATA(3y(B value. The value is identified in the file headers. There are no void pixels inside the project boundary. A visual qualitative assessment was performed to ensure data completeness. No void areas or missing data exist. The bare earth surface is of good quality and passes Vertical Accuracy requirements.iThe Fundamental Vertical Accuracy (FVA) of the LiDAR Point Cloud data was calculated against TINs derived from the final calibrated and controlled swath data. The required accuracy (ACCZ) is: 18.13 cm at a 95% confidence level, derived according to the National Standard for Spatial Database Accuracy (NSSDA), i.e., based on RMSE of 9.25 cm in the (3z(Bopen terrain(3y(B land cover category.j0.09kTested 0.09 meters vertical accuracy at 95 percent confidence level according to the Federal Geographic Data Committee, 1998, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard, Part 3: National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy, FGDC-STD-007.3-1998.  aPA_SandyLiDAR2015.  aArcGIS 10.2; Global Mapper 14; Fugro proprietary software; Windows XP and 7 Operating Systems \\server\directory path\*.img 21 GB. 7aLiDAR.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aTerrain.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aModel.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aElevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aSurface.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aUS.2Geographic Names Information System 7aPennsylvania.2Geographic Names Information System 7aYork County.2Geographic Names Information System 7aLancaster County.2Geographic Names Information System03377nem a2200637Ia 4500008004100000034002100041100005700062245006800119255002700187260004400214270015800258310001400416342002000430352004100450500002200491500002500513506001000538514048200548520001801030538009501048650004401143650004301187650004101230650004001271650004801311650004301359650004701402650004201449650003401491650005401525650005201579650004601631650003401677650003501711650003801746650003401784650003801818650003701856650003501893650006001928650008501988650004002073650003502113650003802148650004102186650007702227650003502304650003502339650003402374650006302408651004302471651005402514651004202568856006702610856006202677040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-75e-74f40g3910aNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)10aShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Elevation Dataset 2010.  c(-75 -- -74/40 -- 39).  aSioux Falls, SDbU.S. Geological Survey  aU.S. Geological Survey EROS Data CenterbSioux FallscSDdUSAe57198k605-594-6151mcustserv@usgs.govpCustomer Services RepresentativeqEROS Data Center  cAs needed  bDecimal degrees  aRasterbGrid Celld158451e327635f1  apublication date.  araster digital data.  aNone.  fThe mission objective is to produce digital topographic map products with &lt;=20 m absolute horizontal circular accuracy.

Rather, the Shapefile has been divided into 4928 blocks, or cells, of equal size.  aground condition.  avector digital data.  aThe Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) and the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) reserve the right to deny requests for large portions of Atlas data or request reimbursement for handling costs.  aAll attribute data (e.g. species, breeding status, survey hours) have been manually inspected for spatial and content (i.e. typos) accuracy. Inspections were performed by running the Breeding Bird Atlas Database and comparing results with the original, bound/hardcopy Atlas.dEach of the 4928 Atlas sample blocks are represented as individual grid cells, and are therefore not subject to logical consistency errors such as overshoots, dangling nodes, duplicate arcs, etc. Coordinate accuracy was tested by overlaying the Atlas sample blocks with the complete set of Pennsylvania 7.5-minute quadrangles; all Atlas sample blocks fit precisely within their parent quadrangles.eThe integrity of geo-referenced data within the Breeding Bird Atlas Database was verified by running the Atlas and comparing results with the original, bound/hardcopy atlas. Users of the Atlas should note that the supporting dBase files contain accessory data, particularly Bbaname.dbf, which features several items (e.g. "AOU_NUM") that are not essential for the Atlas to function properly. These data appeared in the original Breeding Bird Atlas (non-electronic form), however, and have been preserved here. Note: When the Breeding Bird Atlas Database is downloaded from the PASDA website, the links which connect the supporting dBase files to the ArcView shapefile will be lost. In order to use the Atlas, you must first re-establish the links in your ArcView project. Bba.dbf is linked to Bbadat.dbf and Bbaocc.dbf via "BLOCK_ID". Bbaname.dbf is linked to Bbadat.dbf via "SP_CODE".fHorizontal positional accuracy was tested by overlaying the Atlas sample blocks with the complete set of Pennsylvania 7.5-minute quadrangles; all Atlas sample blocks fit precisely within their parent quadrangles.  apabba1994.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRIpComplete information about the Breeding Bird Atlas Database project for Pennsylvania, including grid block design, breeding codes, volunteer effort, species accounts, and distribution maps, can be found in: Brauning, D.W. 1992.

Analog dodging consists of holding back light from certain areas of the sensitized photographic material to avoid overexposure. The diapositive is inspected to ensure clarity and radiometric uniformity. Diapositive image brightness values are collected with a minimum of image quality manipulation. Image brightness values may deviate from the brightness values of the original images because of image value interpolation during the scanning and rectification processes. Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto with the original unrectified image to determine if the digital orthophoto has the same or better image quality as the original unrectified input image. Slight systematic radiometric differences can be detected between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source photograph capture dates and sun angles along flight lines when the aerial photographs were taken. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.fCompliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data. The elevation data were generated by autocorrelation and manual processes. An RMS value for each tile was calculated based on the photos utilized in the production of the tile by comparing the AT X and Y coordinates. This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in U.S. Survey Feet..324 survey feetThe horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the accuracy of the aerotriangulation and digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM accuracy assessment was achieved by comparing the aerotriangulation-derived elevation with the elevation of the DEM at the same X and Y coordinates. In addition, visual examination was employed to assess all tiles and its relative edge match. All results were examined for consistency and its compliance with the NSSDA accuracy standard.  aPAMAP_cycle1.  aZ/I Imaging Orthopro 4.0, Windows NT/2000 Systems. 7arectified photograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7anatural color orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimage map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aImagery/Base Maps/Earth Cover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/04270nem a2200505Ia 4500008004100000034004900041100011400090245001800204255008000222260013000302270006200432310001200494342002800506343001600534352003500550500002200585500002600607506001000633514245800643520001803101538009303119552009603212650002403308650002303332650002303355650002603378650002103404650001603425650000903441650001103450650000903461650002803470650003503498650003103533651001803564651001803582651002003600651002303620651002103643651001903664651002303683651002003706651002003726651001803746040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-78.810999e-78.775046f39.713045g39.68527210aPAMAP Program, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey10aPAMAP cycle2.  bLambert Conformal Conicc(-78.810999 -- -78.775046/39.713045 -- 39.685272).  aMiddletown, PAbPAMAP Program, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey  aPAMAP ProgrambMiddletowncPAdUSAe17057k(717) 702-2053  cUnknown  aLambert Conformal Conic  bsurvey feet  aRasterbPixeld10000e10000f1  aground condition.  aremote-sensing image.  aNone.  aThe accuracy of the ground control is confirmed by the evaluation of the results of the analytical bundle adjustment.

The accuracy described will be in the terms used in the FGDC Content Standards for Framework Land Elevation Data . Accuracy will be determined and reported using the methodology specified in the FGDC National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy. Until an independent overall assessment of the accuracy of NED is completed, it is best to refer to published information on the accuracy of the source digital elevation models (DEM's) from which NED was assembled. The primary source data were the USGS 7.5-minute (30-meter or 10-meter resolution) DEM's. Gaps in the 7.5-minute DEM coverage were filled with data from USGS 30-minute (2-arc-second resolution) or 1-degree (3-arc-second resolution) DEM's. The USGS Data Users Guide 5 for DEM's (traditionally known as the "blue book"), last published in 1993, contains a general discussion of DEM accuracy and a brief description of the accuracy testing methodology. The DEM data users guide also describes the classification levels of standard USGS DEM products. The level of a DEM is defined, in part, on the basis of its accuracy. 30NED sources for Pennsylvania 30-meter and 10-meter resolution DEM data, 10-meter data was resampled to 30-meter resolution for assembly of the nationwide dataset.  apaned. 7a7.5-MINUTE DEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aCARTOGRAPHY.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aDIGITAL MAPPING.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aEARTH SCIENCE.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aEDC.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aEROS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aGEODATA.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aGIS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aLAND SURFACE.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aLANDFORMS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aMAPPING.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aRASTER.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aTERRAIN ELEVATION.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aTOPOGRAPHY.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aUSGS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aElevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aPennsylvania.2GCMD Location Keywords40zConnect to this dataset online.uftp://www.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/ned09434nem a2200421Ia 4500008004100000034005300041037002800094100021700122245007300339255005900412260004500471270027400516310001400790342004000804342013100844352001100975500003500986500002501021500054301046506001001589514586701599520002007466538009507486552060707581650004708188650004508235650004808280650004508328650004708373650004308420650004708463650004708510650004908557650004408606650004608650651025908696856005708955040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d -82.715370e -73.999580f 43.373860g 37.000140  gArcGIS Geodatabase, 8.310aU.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, USDA Forest Service, and other Federal, State and local partners (see dataset specific metadata under Data_Set_Credit for details).10aNational Hydrography Dataset (NHD) - High-resolution: area features.  c( -82.715370 --  -73.999580/ 43.373860 --  37.000140).  aReston, VirginiabU.S. Geological Survey  a507 National CenterbRestoncVAdUSAe20192k1 888 ASK USGSmnhd@usgs.govr0800-1600 Eastern TimezIn addition to the address above there are other ESIC offices throughout the country.

This NHD area dataset was compiled for Pennsylvania from subregions 0204, 0205, 0206, 0207, 0412, 0413, 0501, 0502, and 0503. Subregion datasets were extracted as shapefiles from geodatabase in ArcCatalog, and merged in Arcview 3.3. Current status of the NHD subbasins including availability, partners, POC's, etc., is available from the NHD Geodatabase web site (nhdgeo.usgs.gov) as well as the Status Graphics web site (statgraph.cr.usgs.gov).  aNone.  aStatements of attribute accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey Digital Line Graph (DLG) data, which is estimated to be 98.5 percent. One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which most often are the published USGS topographic quadrangle and/or the USDA Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Reaches codes are defined on all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, coastline, and connector. Waterbody reach codes are defined on all lake/pond and most reservoir features. Names were applied from the GNIS database. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has not been methodically checked, and so a name may be applied to the wrong reaches. Anecdotal reviews indicate that 80% or more of the named reaches have the correct name. Reaches were delineated with a batch procedure and were checked extensively during the visual pass steps of processing. Based on automated quality assurance/quality control checks performed at various intervals during the processing, approximately 99% of the reaches are delineated according to standards.dPoints, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which, in the initial release of the National Hydrography Dataset, most often are U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps. Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected, so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres (approximately 2.4 hectares) were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Some map quadrangles have a much sparser pattern of hydrography than do adjoining maps, and these differences continue in the digital rendition of these features. A priority for maintenance of the National Hydrography Dataset is the rectification of these differences. Transport reaches are defined on almost all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, pipeline, artificial path, and connector. Water body reaches are defined on the subset of lake/pond features that were identified as water bodies during the development of Reach File Version 3. Most attention in applying geographic names was given to transport reaches that follow stream/rivers, and Water body reaches. Near the international boundaries with Canada and Mexico, only the parts of features within the United States are delineated. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the "Standards for National Hydrography Dataset" (USGS, 1999), available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/.

Linear features of the same type along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if the are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). To align the features, the midpoint between the end of the corresponding features is computed, and the ends of features are moved to this point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector was added to join the features.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps.

This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.fStatements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be found in the NHDMetadata table.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has not been methodically checked, and so a name may be applied to the wrong reaches. Anecdotal reviews indicate that 80% or more of the named reaches have the correct name.

Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines.

All areas close.eThe completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources, which, in the initial release of the National Hydrography Dataset, most often are U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps. Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected, so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres (approximately 2.4 hectares) were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Some map quadrangles have a much sparser pattern of hydrography than do adjoining maps, and these differences continue in the digital rendition of these features. A priority for maintenance of the National Hydrography Dataset is the rectification of these differences. Transport reaches are defined on almost all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, pipeline, artificial path, and connector. Water body reaches are defined on the subset of lake/pond features that were identified as water bodies during the development of Reach File Version 3.

For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where there are many features to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Linear features of the same type along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if the are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). To align the features, the midpoint between the end of the corresponding features is computed, and the ends of features are moved to this point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector was added to join the features.iStatements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map.  apanhdwatersheds.  aMicrosoft Windows 2000 Version 5.0 (Build 2195) Service Pack 4; ESRI ArcCatalog 8.3.0.800.  cOBJECTIDdInternal feature number., ESRIpThe names and definitions of all feature types, characteristics, and values are in U.S. Geological Survey, 1999, Standards for National Hydrography Dataset: Reston, Virginia, U.S. Geological Survey.

A target mapping unit (tmu) is an estimate of the size class of the smallest group of wetlands that NWI attempts to map consistently; it is not the smallest wetland mapped. Recognize that some wetland types are conspicuous and readily mapped (e.g., marshes and ponds) and smaller ones may be mapped. Drier wetlands and forested wetlands (especially evergreen) are more difficult to photointerpret and larger ones may be missed. The tmu also varies with photo scale; in forested regions, the tmu may be 3-5 acres (1:80K photos), 1-3 acres (1:58K), or 1 acre (1:40K). NWI maps should show most wetlands larger than the tmu. In the treeless prairies, a 1/4 acre tmu is possible due to the openness of terrain and occurrence of wetlands in distinct depressions. Take notice of the photo scale/type used to make the maps (see legend) and realize that black and white photos tend to yield more conservative interpretations than color infrared film. Most farmed wetlands (e.g., mucklands) are usually not mapped, except for pothole-type wetlands, cranberry bogs, and diked former tidelands (Sacramento Valley). Partly drained wetlands are conservatively mapped due to photointerpretation limitations. No attempt was made to identify regulated wetlands from other wetlands. Recognize that maps produced through photointerpretation are not as accurate as one prepared from on-the-ground surveys, so NWI boundaries are generalized.  apanwiline.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7awetlands.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ahydrologic.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aland cover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7asurface and manmade features.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ainlandWaters.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7abiota.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPennsylvania.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/04572nem a2200349Ia 4500008004100000034005300041100003500094245005800129255005900187260005900246270011900305310001400424342004000438342008100478352001100559500002200570500002500592500018800617506001000805514290100815520001603716538009303732552003903825650004203864650004403906650004403950650006203994650004604056650003904102651001804141856006304159040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d -80.518180e -75.034220f 42.234800g 39.72118010aU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service10aNational Wetlands Inventory for Pennsylvania - point.  c( -80.518180 --  -75.034220/ 42.234800 --  39.721180).  aSt.Petersburg, FloridabU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  a115 Land and Water BuildiingbUniversity ParkcPennsylvaniadUnited Statese16801k(814) 865 - 8792mpasda@psu.edu  cIrregular  bDecimal degreesc0.000010d0.000010  t1.000000uExplicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates  aVector  aground condition.  avector digital data.  aNational Wetlands Inventory information for this element varies for each 7.5' quad.

This is to ensure that a particular color will remain consistent thoughout a DRG series. For these raster images derived from the MapTech Historical collection at http://historical.maptech.com, there is no guarantee given for consistent colors. This is due to the fact that images downloaded from the collection as jpegs had a 16 million color resolution, and after being combined, were reduced by an optimal best match method to 256 color (8 bit) depth.dGreat care was taken by eye to seam together the four separate jpeg images that were scanned for each topographic map at library sites. Because of small levels of inaccuracy due to image rotation or scanner operation, there are varying amounts of error at seams where the images line up. As other methods of lining up images automatically through software become available, some of these historical map images may be redone and replaced.  apasda-psu-edu&gt;  aMicrosoft Windows 2000 Version 5.0 (Build 2195) Service Pack 4; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535.  cObjectIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7araster image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopopgraphic quadrangle.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adrg.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital raster graphic.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ahistoric.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPennsylvania.40zConnect to this dataset online.uftp://www.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/maptech_historic/01901nem a2200325Ia 4500008004100000034003900041037001100080100002700091245008300118255004500201270007100246310001700317352003300334500002200367500002600389506003400415514048900449520007000938538009501008552004501103650004601148650004901194650005701243650003701300650005601337650004201393650005901435651001801494856006301512040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-80.875e-74.625f42.3750g39.6250  gTIFF, 10aU.S. Geological Survey10aHistorical 15 minute series USGS Map Collection for Pennsylvania, 2nd version.  c(-80.875 -- -74.625/42.3750 -- 39.6250).  aLand and Water BuildingbUniversity ParkcPAe16802mpasda@psu.edu  cNone planned  aRasterbPixeld3818e3105f1  apublication date.  aremote-sensing image.  aFor historical purposes only.  aUSGS digital raster graphics (DRG's) normally use a standard palette to ensure uniform color throughout a particular map series.

Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).dCertain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch. The Soil Survey of Adams County, Pennsylvania is edgematched to the adjacent SSURGO certified Pennsylvania Soil Surveys of York County and Franklin County and the adjacent SSURGO certified Maryland Soil Surveys of Carroll County and Frederick County. Feature edges and descriptive attributes of this soil survey are matched to those in Franklin and York Counties. Soil delineations are matched to those in Carroll County, Maryland, but do not match descriptive attributes exactly. Feature labels do not match adjacent soil surveys exactly. The soil survey area boundaries match.eA map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified on the map is a delineation. Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas that have properties and behavior significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map. A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas (map unit components), each with a designated range in proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little or no recognizable soil. Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units, and location of special soil features. These standards are outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993, USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995, USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS. The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on data collected by scientists during the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and undifferentiated groups. Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting. Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist of two or more dissimilar components that occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether complex or association is used in the name. The major components of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In either case, because the major components are sufficiently different in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association, each major component is normally present though their proportions may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent. Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two or more components that are not consistently associated geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in the same map delineation. These components are included in the same named map unit because their use and management are the same or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations. Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend, one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per 3,000 acres. A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about 5 acres.fThe accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000 feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units. For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very narrow.   fSoil delineation boundaries and special soil features generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.  aPennsylvania_soil_metadata_201409.  cSpecial Soil Features CodesdSpecial Soil Features labels represent specific Special Soil Features.

The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.dThe Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of shapefiles. Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files. Most of the codes for geographic entities except states, counties, urban areas, Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), American Indian Areas (AIAs), and congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency. For the TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the shapefile attribute table. For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature. TIGER/Line Shapefile multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification. Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.eData completeness of the TIGER/Line Shapefiles reflects the contents of the Census MAF/TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line Shapefiles were created.  aPhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3;

As a part of the ISTAR workflow, the data from the color channels is edge sharpened using the nadir panchromatic channel. The orthophoto mosaics are inspected for accuracy issues that fall in the following categories: Aerotriangulation related DSM related Accuracy issues will be investigated through review and correction of the DSM or triangulation adjustment. Once the imagery has passed quality control review, final radiometric adjustments are performed to create a uniform overall appearance.dAll GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived. This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements. Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. Seamline mismatches are not corrected unless the overall displacement exceeds one meter.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free. Photography was flown during leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Coastal areas and international boundary regions may have areas without images (void areas) in parts of the coverage. These void areas have a radiometric value of either zero (black) or 128 (uniform gray).fCompliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data. Using several tools that are part of the ISTAR workflow, a digital surface model (DSM) was correlated at a post spacing of 2 meter depending on terrain and land cover. The ISTAR correlation algorithm computes the X,Y,Z value for each DSM post utilizing every stereo angle that is available. A series of DSM files were created for each acquisition block, one for each stereo look angle. A mosaic was then created from the separate DSM files where the best vertical value for each posting was selected from all look angles compared against the aerotriangulation adjustment which is incorporated into the mosaic. EarthData will then edit the surface to the level required to support the orthophoto production. An RMS value was determined by comparing the position of USGS ground test points to their photo-id'ed position in the rectified imagery. This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in meters. 0.40 The horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the accuracy of the aerotriangulation and digital surface model (DSM). For each rectified image (lift), an RMSE value for all of the standard errors of the tie/pass/control points located in that image (lift) and computed by the aerotriangulation solution was calculated. The DSM accuracy assessment was achieved by comparing the aerotriangulation-derived elevation with the elevation of the DSM. In addition, visual examination was employed to assess all tiles and its relative edge match. All results were examined for consistency and its compliance with the NSSDA accuracy standard.  apittsburghpa2005a_orthoimagery.  aLeica ADS40 Digital Camera System ISTAR Digital Image Processing Software Z/I Imaging Orthopro 4.0 Windows NT/2000 Systems.  pU.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, 1996, Standards for Digital Orthophotos: Reston, VA. 7a0.3 meter orthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7anatural color orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimage map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aUS.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPittsburgh.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aAllegeny County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aBeaver County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aWashington county.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPA.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aPittsburgh, PA.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aAllegheny County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology. 7aBeaver County.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.40zConnect to this dataset online.uftp://pamap.pasda.psu.edu/nga-usgs_imagery/08153nem a2200433Ia 4500008004100000034013300041100003400174245011700208255017300325270051000498310001401008343001101022500002201033500002601055506001001081514337901091520004204470538012804512552011404640650005404754650004904808650004404857650005804901650004404959650004305003650005905046650003905105650004405144651026505188651027305453651027805726651027606004651028006280651026506560651027706825651027907102651027607381856006207657040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d           -80.5305532         e           -79.6328985         f           40.8660867         g           40.1157491         10aU.S. Geological Survey (USGS)10aTILE INDEX - USGS High Resolution Orthoimage for the Pittsburgh, PA (Allegheny and Beaver Counties), Urban Area.  c(           -80.5305532          --            -79.6328985         /           40.8660867          --            40.1157491         ).d(Universal Transverse Mercator).  aEROS Data Center 47914 252nd StreetbSioux FallscSDdUSe57198-0001h1-605-594-6933k1-800-252-4547mcustserv@usgs.govrMonday through Friday 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM (Central Time)zThe above is the contact information for EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, SD.

Users can ensure parcel polygons have up to date ownership attribution after the publication date by contacting your regional LRD office or downloading the Current_Tract_Ownership_Data file located on the NPS Data Store (http://science.nature.nps.gov/nrdata/) in a dBase format. Please contact the data originator with any suggested corrections and updates. LRD's boundary polygons represent the current legislated boundary of a given NPS unit. NPS does not necessarily have full fee ownership or hold another interest (easement, right of way, etc...) in all parcels contained within this boundary. Equivalently NPS may own or have an interest in parcels outside the legislated boundary of a given unit. In order to obtain complete information about current NPS interests both inside and outside the units legislated boundary, LRD's tracts files should also be downloaded and used in conjunction with LRD's boundary files. Downloaded the historical USGS source maps identified above and evaluated the quality of their georeferencing by inspecting alignment of coordinates with printed grid lines on the digital maps. All source digital data were found to have mapped latitudes and longitudes that were within 0.1 seconds of the graticule coordinates printed on the map collars. Georeferenced each spliced section of the River Management Plan maps to their corresponding HTMC map using ArcGIS for Desktop software and an adjust transformation that minimizes local and global alignment errors. Used at least 100 control points per spliced section based on well-distributed, readily identifiable features until a zero error was reported for the adjust transformation. Spliced sections were rectified to the coordinate system of the source HTMC map. Evaluated discrepancies between the location of the boundary on overlapping sections of the georeferenced 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan maps. Areas of discrepancies were handled as follows: &#x2022; Page 1-2 south/west overlap areas: The page 1 boundary was followed through the overlap area. At the western edge of page 2, the trajectory of the page 1 boundary was continued due east approximately 27 meters until it met with the page 2 boundary at 7511&#x2019;7.334&#x2019;&#x2019;W, 4151&#x2019;7.738&#x2019;&#x2019;N. This resulted in exclusion of an approximately 52 meter stretch of the page 2 boundary that did not coincide with the trajectory of the page 1 boundary. The boundary as drawn on the georeferenced sections from the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan was digitized with the map display set to 1:24,000. In accordance with the Superintendent's decision, the outside of the boundary line was followed during digitization and the overlap areas were handled as outlined above. The coordinate system of the boundary vector layer was set to that of the Page 4 N section, which is nearest the geometric center of the boundary. Splice lines in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan boundary maps were identified by visually inspecting 600 dpi scans created from the early printed edition of the hardcopy plan. Source data for the spliced River Management Plan boundary map sections were identified by systematically reviewing all 1:24,000 7.5 minute quadrangle topographic maps published by the USGS between 1965-1985 for the Upper Delaware Region: Page, Page Position = HTMC Source Map 1, NW section = PA_Hancock_170733_1965_24000 1, NE section = NY_Fishs Eddy_138154_1965_24000 1, SW section = PA_Lake Como_171007_1968_24000 1, SE section = PA_Long Eddy_172240_1965_24000 2, N section = NY_Fishs Eddy_138154_1965_24000 2, W section = PA_Long Eddy_172240_1965_24000 2, E section = NY_Callicoon_123144_1965_24000 3, N section = NY_Callicoon_123144_1965_24000 3, S section = PA_Damascus_170464_1968_24000 4, N section = PA_Damascus_170464_1968_24000 4, S section = NY_Narrowsburg_130762_1968_24000 5, NW section = NY_Narrowsburg_130762_1968_24000 5, NE section = NY_Eldred_138052_1967_24000 5, SW section = PA_Rowland_221690_1966_24000 5, SE section = PA_Shohola_221953_1965_24000 6, NW section = NY_Narrowsburg_130762_1968_24000 6, NE section = NY_Eldred_138052_1967_24000 6, SW section = PA_Rowland_221690_1966_24000 6, SE section = PA_Shohola_221953_1965_24000 7, N section = NY_Eldred_138052_1967_24000 7, W section = PA_Shohola_221953_1965_24000 7, E section = NY_Pond Eddy_129067_1965_24000 8, W section = NY_Pond Eddy_129067_1965_24000 8, E section = NY_Port Jervis North_129100_1969_24000. Page 1-2 north/east overlap areas: Boundaries drawn on page 1 and 2 do not cross in the page 1-2 overlap area. Therefore, to create a smooth transition between the boundary as drawn on page 1 and 2, a linkage was drawn between the page 1 boundary at 7511&#x2019;11.026&#x2019;&#x2019;W, 4152&#x2019;36.316&#x2019;&#x2019;N and the page 2 boundary at 7511&#x2019;8.522&#x2019;&#x2019;W. &#x2022; Page 2-3 south/west overlap areas: As stated in the River Management Plan&#x2019;s Errata number 5, (3z(BMap 2 of 8 following page 60 contains a mapping error in Machester Township &#x2026; The boundary in this area is correctly shown on map 3 of 8.(3y(B Therefore, the page 3 boundary was followed throughout the page 2-3 overlap area, except at the northern terminus of page 3 where the boundary does not link to the southern terminus of the page 2 boundary.

Page 7-8 north/east overlap areas: The page 8 boundary made smooth transitions to the boundary as shown outside the page 7 -8 overlap at both the northern and southern termini of the area of intersection. The page 7 and 8 boundaries were also coincident throughout most of the area. Therefore, the page 8 boundary was followed throughout. The boundary as drawn on the georeferenced sections from the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan was digitized with the map display set to 1:24,000. In accordance with the Superintendent's decision, the outside of the boundary line was followed during digitization and the overlap areas were handled as outlined above.

The digital data herein are derived from the eight pages of maps in the 1986 River Management Plan, which are considered the authoritative representation of the administrative boundary. The digital data herein are limited by the accuracy of the source print data and the georeferencing and digitizing methods used in their production. Horizontal positional accuracy of the mapped data was estimated as follows: 1) The boundary as drawn on USGS 7.5' topo maps in the River Management Plan was assumed to adhere to the National Map Accuracy Standard of 90% of mapped locations being within 1/50th of an inch of their actual location (within 40 feet, or ~12.2 meters). 2) A margin of error of approximately seven pixels was estimated for the georeferencing and digitizing procedures, adding another 18.2 meter zone of uncertainty around the digitized boundary location (2.6 meter pixel size * 7 pixels = 18.2 meters). 3) Estimates of positional uncertainty from the above sources were summed and rounded to the nearest whole number (12.2 + 18.2 = 30.4 meters), arriving at a final estimate of the mapped data being within 30 meters of the actual ground location. The boundary was digitized based on the eight-page paper boundary map published in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan georeferenced to 7.5 minute quadrangle topo maps from the USGS Historical Topographic Map Collection. In accordance with the Superintendent's decision, and in order to err on the side of resource protection, the outside of the boundary line was followed during digitization. The area and perimeter attributes accompanying the spatial data are unofficial values computed using GIS tools and are based on the dataset's native coordinate system, North_American_1927_Polyconic. The authoritative area of the boundary as given in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan is 55,574.5 acres. The horizontal position of the mapped data is estimated to be within 30 meters of the actual ground location based on the National Map Accuracy Standard and observed limitations of the georeferencing and digitizing methods. Page 3-4 south/west overlap areas: The page 3 and 4 boundaries are consistent with one another throughout the area of overlap so no decisions had to be made about which one to follow.iNone  aUPDE_ScenicRecWaterLandRef_2015.  aMicrosoft Windows 7 Version 6.1 (Build 7601) Service Pack 1; Esri ArcGIS 10.2.0.3348.  cFIDdInternal feature number., Esrip"Land Acquisition Procedures (LAPS)", Mapping Standards - Chapter 5, revised 2009. 0aBoundary. 0aLRDCAB. 0aOwnership. 0aParcels. 0aTracts. 0aBoundaries. 0aPlanning Cadastre. 7aPennsylvania.2National Park System Unit Code Thesaurus 7aUnited States.2National Park System Unit Code Thesaurus 7aNational Park Service.2National Park System Unit Code Thesaurus 7aUpper Delaware National Scenic and Recreation River.2National Park System Unit Code Thesaurus 7aNew York.2National Park System Unit Code Thesaurus 7aNERO.2National Park System Unit Code Thesaurus40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://nrdata.nps.gov/programs/Lands/upde_tracts.zip40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/02764nem a2200469Ia 4500008004100000034004900041100005000090245009700140255005500237270011400292310001700406352001100423500002200434500002500456506001000481514087500491520004701366538008901413552004001502650005001542650004301592650003901635650004301674650005201717650004601769650003801815650005301853650004301906650004301949650004601992651001802038651001802056651001602074651001802090651001902108651002002127651002102147651002302168651001702191651002302208856006302231040801u9999    xx         u        und d1 d-77.045832e-76.714319f40.399386g40.17310810aUnited States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)10aFlood Inundation Mapping for Susquehanna River in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania - 11-ft to 37-ft.  c(-77.045832 -- -76.714319/40.399386 -- 40.173108).  a100 Penn Square EastbPhiladelphiacPennsylvaniadUSe19107-3390k215-656-6549mjason.f.miller@usace.army.mil  cNone planned  aVector  apublication date.  avector digital data.  aNone.  aSource data has an average error which meets or exceeds +/- 3 meters for well defined points across the full dataset.

These data are intended to be cartographically complete at a 1:24,000 scale.fThis US Topo map product is compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within 0.02 inch of the true position. In this product, the projection line, grids, and orthoimage are believed to meet NMAS. Positional accuracy of the other data layers is less controllable because of diversity of data sources, and may not meet NMAS.,An explanation of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements and a description of the tests used. This must be entered by the contractor to reflect their methods. This is provided only as a sample of the type of information needed. "Tested" can only be used when data testing is performed against independent checkpoints from a source of higher accuracy.iThe accuracy of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) is inherited from the source digital elevation models (DEMs). The overall absolute vertical accuracy expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.44 meters. The measured vertical RMSE was converted to equivalent NMAS and NSSDA expressions. The accuracy is expressed in terms of the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS), which use a 90 percent confidence interval, and in terms of the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA), which uses a 95 percent confidence interval.  aUSGS_GEOpdf2014.  pU.S. Department of the Interior, Draft US Topo Product Standard, Version 0.5.10.,Enter reference to the complete description of the entity types, attributes, and attribute values for the data set.

No points have been removed or excluded. A visual qualitative assessment was performed to ensure data completeness. No void areas or missing data exist. The raw point cloud is of good quality and data passes Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy specifications.iThe specifications require that only raw Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) be computed for raw lidar point cloud swath files. The raw NVA was tested with 35 independent survey points distributed throughout the project area and located in open terrain. These checkpoints were not used in the calibration or post-processing of the lidar point cloud data. Specifications for this project require that the raw NVA be 19.6 cm or better AccuracyZ at 95 percent confidence level. The specifications require that Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) be computed for DEM files. The NVA was tested with 35 independent survey points distributed throughout the project area and located in open terrain.

Specifications for this project require that the NVA be 19.6 cm or better AccuracyZ at 95 percent confidence level. The specifications require that Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (VVA) be computed for DEM files. The VVA was tested with 35 independent survey points distributed throughout the project area and located in vegetated terrain. These checkpoints were not used in the calibration or post-processing of the lidar point cloud data. Specifications for this project require that the VVA be 29.4 cm or better at the 95th percentile.j0.059kThe raw NVA was tested using 35 independent survey points located in open terrain. The surveyed checkpoints were distributed throughout the project area and surveyed using GNSS procedures and methodologies that provide reliable and consistent results to meet the project's accuracy requirements. Please see the "Survey Accuracy Requirements" and "Field Methodology" sections in the Survey Report for more information. Elevations from the unclassified lidar surface were measured for the x,y location of each check point. Elevations interpolated from the unclassified lidar surface were then compared to the elevation values of the surveyed control. The RMSEz was computed to be 0.099 meters (0.030 feet) and AccuracyZ to be 0.193 meters (0.059 feet). This meets the required AccuracyZ value of 19.6 cm raw NVA at 95 percent confidence level using (RMSEz * 1.9600) as defined by the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA); assessed and reported using National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP)/ASPRS Guidelines.  aUSGSLiDAR_DauphinCoPA_2016.  aMicroStation Version 8;

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.dAll GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived. This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements. Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. Seamline mismatches are corrected unless the overall displacement is less than one pixel.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free.

Some of the reports were as latitude-longitude coordinates, some as river miles, and others as just a lake, beach, harbor, or a water body and nearest town name. The locations were digitized as a single point in the reported water body at the place nearest to the town. If no specific location was reported in a lake, the point was digitized in the middle. These were all small lakes; the Great Lakes had specific locations associated with them. Each zebra mussel sighting location was checked by manual comparison of the on-screen point with hard copy maps.  aZebraMusselDistribution2008.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.1.0.722.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7abiota.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aAquatic.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aFreshwater.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aExotic.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aZebra mussels.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aDreissena polymorpha.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aGIS.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aLakes.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aNon-native.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aNon-indigenous.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aRivers.2ISO 19115 Topic Category 7aUnited States.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of 7aCanada.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of 7aOntario.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of 7aQuebec.2U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html?openChapters=chpbio#chpbio
