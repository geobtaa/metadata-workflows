Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL),2020,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"The Clean Water Act Section 303(d) establishes the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program. The purpose of the TMDL program is to identify sources of pollution and allocate pollutant loads in places where water quality goals are not being achieved.

The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources.
TMDLs can be developed for several categories such as: point sources (permitted sewage and industrial discharges); nonpoint sources (agriculture and urban runoff); lakes; abandoned mine drainage (also called acid mine drainage or AMD); specific bioaccumulative chemicals (PCBs and chlordane that contaminate fish, resulting in fish advisories limiting or banning the number of fish that a person can safely consume); and complex situations (combinations of different types).

The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources.
This layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them.  Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.  This layer is based on the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=TotalMaximumDailyLoadLakes2020_10.xml

Allegheny County - Street Centerlines,2020,Allegheny County,"This dataset contains street centerlines for vehicular and foot traffic in Allegheny County.  Street Centerlines are classified as Primary Road, Secondary Road, Unpaved Road, Limited Access Road, Connecting Road, Jeep Trail, Walkway, Stairway, Alleyway and Unknown.

A Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction.  A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction.  An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel.  A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway.  A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street.  A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together.  Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature.  A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation.  A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature.  A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed.

Centerlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement.  One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement.  Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present.

For roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement.

All attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated.  For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR.  If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004.  The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified.

The ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps.  Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed.  In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads.
Street Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset.  In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area.

Street Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area.

The Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field.  In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset.  When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004.  All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values.  All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used.  In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection.  Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range.  All new Street Centerlines will have zero (0) for ""SystemID"" and ""UserID"".",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=AlleghenyCounty_StreetCenterlines202012.xml

"Allegheny County -Tree Canopy Change, 2010-2015",2020,Allegheny County,"Tree canopy change in Allegheny County Pennsylvania for the years 2010 to 2015. This tree canopy change data set consists of three classes: no change, gain, and loss. No change polygons are those in which the tree canopy remained the same between the two time periods. Gain polygons are those in which tree canopy increased between the two time periods. Loss polygons are those in which tree canopy decrease between the two time periods. 2010 tree canopy can be calculated by adding the “no change” and loss classes. Tree canopy for 2015 can be calculated by adding the “no change” and “gain” classes.Several data sets were used to map tree canopy change. The starting point was the 2010 high-resolution land cover data set developed for Allegheny County. Change was then mapped using leaf-off lidar data collected in 2006, 4-band leaf-on National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data collected in 2010, leaf off lidar data collected in 2015, and 4-band leaf-on NAIP data collected in 2015. All four data sets were integratedinto an object-based image analysis system (OBIA), which a rule-based expert system. A combination of segmentation, classification, and morphology algorithms were employed to determine if tree canopy had changed between the two time periods. The data set was then manually edited at a scale of 1:5000. The main factors determining change were a decrease in height, indicating tree removal, as identified by the lidar, and the change in the spectral characteristics, as identified in the aerial imagery. There were spatial misalignment issues between all four of the data sets. As a result, very fine scale changes at the edges of tree canopy could not be determined. The data set can thus be considered to be slightly biased towards tree canopy loss, and fine-scale tree canopy gains could not be determined. Most of the gain identified is not new growth, but rather canopy from trees that were too small to be detected in the original 2010 mapping.The incorporation of newer lidar data enabled a revisit of the original 2010 tree canopy mapping. The 2015 lidar data was substantially higher quality than the 2006 lidar data used for the 2010 high-resolution land cover mapping project. This enabled errors of omission and commission in the original 2010 tree canopy mapping to be corrected. Examples include shrubby areas in 2010 falsely classified as tree canopy and tall trees that were not clearly visible in the data used to map tree canopy in 2010. This data set should be considered to be the most accurate depiction of tree canopy for both the 2010 and 2015 time periods.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=AlleghenyCounty_TreeCanopyChange_2010_2015__2020.xml

The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file.

GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information.

York County - Natural Areas Inventory,2018,York County,"This shapefile contains the Core Habitat of Biological Diversity Areas identified through the County Natural Heritage Inventory program of the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program. County Natural Heritage Inventories focus on areas that are the best examples of ecological resources in a county. Although agricultural lands and open space may be included as part of inventory areas, the emphasis for the designation and delineation of the areas are the ecological values present. Important selection criteria for Natural Heritage Areas are the existence of habitat for plants and animals of special concern, the existence of uncommon or especially important natural communities, and the size and landscape context of a site containing good quality natural features. Large areas and areas that are minimally disturbed by development provide the backbone that links habitats and allows plants and animals to shift and move across sizable portions of the landscape. Core Habitat areas are intended to identify the essential habitat of the species of concern or natural community that can absorb very little activity or disturbance without substantial impact to the natural features. Polygons are based on aerial photo interpretation, field surveys, and existing PNDI data and were delineated by the ecologists on-screen using ArcView (ESRI, Inc., Version 3.3, 8x, and 9x) with the 1:24,000 scale USGS Digital Raster Graphics and/or Digital Aerial Photography images as a background. For each core habitat polygon, the attribute table contains fields indicating the Site Name and Significance.

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=Pennsylvania_soil_metadata_201409.xml

Stormwater 167,2020,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"Stormwater management involves the control of water that runs off the surface of the land from rain or melting ice or snow. The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code.

Land Recycling Cleanup Locations (LRCL) are divided into one or more sub-facilities categorized as media: Air, Contained Release or Abandoned Container, Groundwater, Sediment, Soil, Surface Water, and Waste. Media is the environmental resource that is associated with the cleanup effort. The following primary facility kinds describe the Acts from which cleanup locations are derived:

Act2 Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards
The first declaration of Section 102 of the policy provides a brief description of the purpose of Act2: 

The elimination of public health and environmental hazards on existing commercial and industrial land across this Commonwealth is vital to their use and reuse as sources of employment, housing, recreation, and open-space areas. The reuse of industrial land is an important component of a sound land use policy that will help prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open-space areas and natural areas and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure.

CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund
This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: 

Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur 
Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding 
Evaluate damages to natural resources 

HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act

[This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners.

Ancillary data sources such as LiDAR-derived breaklines for roads and hydrology were used to augment the land-cover mapping. This land-cover dataset is considered current based on data of acquisition for the leaf-on orthoimagery. Land-cover class assignment was accomplished using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:3000 and all observable errors were corrected.This dataset was developed to support land-cover mapping and modeling initiatives in Commonwealth of Pennsylvannia. At the time of its publication, it represented the most accurate and detailed land cover map for the state.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=landcover_2013_pennsylvania.xml
