    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Contours accurately depict and reflect the crown and cross slope of paved areas including roads and paved ditches and accurately depict all drainage ways.  Ninety percent of all elevations from contours will have an accuracy, with respect to true elevation, of within of one half of the contour interval.  Ten percent of elevations will not be in error by more than one contour interval. The contours are created from the DTM Feature Dataset.  Contours are divided into two (2) main groups; Index Contours and Intermediate Contours.  Every fifth contour is classified as an Index Contour and has an elevation interval of a multiple of 25'.  Index Contours will be labeled with annotation displaying the elevation of the contour.  Contours will not be broken for the placement of the contour label.  The contour will be drawn through the label.  All other contours are Intermediate Contours.

Where appropriate, contours are assigned an additional classification of Hidden, Obscure and Depression.  Contours that are created and fall within a building or under a bridge, as a result of creating continuous contours, are coded as Hidden.  Obscure Contours are contours that are in an area where the ground is obscured from view on the aerial photography.  Obscure Contours will also fall within an Obscure Area Boundary.  The Obscure Contours should not be considered accurate as they only give a general representation of the surface of the earth.  Depression Contours are closed contours that form a sunken area (depression).  Some depressions can cover a large area of land and may not be seen as a depression at a large scale.

The contours were created using Bentely SelectCAD software and the following settings:
"	Import Surface
o	Thin Surface: Off
o	Breaklines
"	Maximum Segment Length: Off
"	Point Density:Off
o	Mass Points
"	Maximum Segment Length:Off
"	Triangulate Surface
o	Maximum Length: 0.0
o	Filter Tolerance: 0.0
"	View Contours:
o	Display As Linestring
o	Minimum Area: 500.0
o	Clip Contours on Steep Slopes: No
o	Smooth: On

        <srccontr>Digital Globe and Michael Baker Corporation held a contract with Allegheny County to fly the County to produce digital orthophotography and to update planimetric base data for  Allegheny County.  Subcontractors for the project included: T3 Global Strategies, Sweet Solutions and Keystone Aerial Surveys.</srccontr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Using existing County DTM files referenced to NGVD 1929 Vertical Datum, an average countywide elevation difference between the cuerrent data and the NAVD 1988 was determined. Existing DTM was shifted the averaged amount, enabling it to be updated to meet the NMAS (National Mapping Accuracy Standards) vertical accuracy requirements for 5' contour mapping.Corresponding MicroStation graphics files in stereo model units were generated. With the use of softcopy stereo workstations, each MicroStation model file of existing data was super-imposed on the corresponding stereo imagery created during this fly-over. Break lines, mass points and breaklines were updated as needed. Breaklines were captured at all slope breaks such as ridge and valley lines, roads and railroads. All hydrographic features were captured as breaklines and used in the triangulation process to ensure contour turnbacks that fit the water features. The same rules were applied to new compilation and updates.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>
The normal mass point density of 20-25 times the contour interval may have been adjusted depending on the type of terrain being mapped. Uneven terrain requires a denser spacing than flat or gently rolling terrain. In addition spot elevations were digitized in the DTM file at the following locations:
Road/railroad intersections
On the road centerline at the abutment and center of bridges and similar structures
On road centerlines over major culverts
At the crest of closed contours
At the lowest point of all closed depression contours, significant saddles, cuts and depressions
At the intersection point of tributaries with the center of the main channel
In areas of dense vegetation where the ground is visible
</procdesc>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Following the completion of the DTM data collection, check contours were developed by the stereo operator, enabling them to be viewed with the stereo model. InRoads Software loads the features from the DTM and generates a three dimensional contour file. Spot elevations could then be added at peaks and saddles, as well as additional breaklines and mass points, if needed. When the stereo operator was satisfied with the DTM, files were provided to map editors for final contour generation and editing.</procdesc>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Tiles were created for the contour data based on the Allegheny County tiling scheme. As a sufficient backlog of completed models were generated, the DTM model files were combined for the tile, a TTN created and 3D contours generated. Contours were generated at five (5) foot intervals with a twenty-five (25) foot index. Index contours were generated at a heavier weight and were automatically labeled. All contours are continuous. They were processed with building data if available and segments within buildings and under bridges are coded as hidden. Each contour is tagged with its elevation and attributed accordingly. Before submitting tiles for translation to ArcInfo coverages, the following automated data validation processes were performed: GraphicsVerify; LineCheck; EdgeMatch.</procdesc>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>ArcInfo coverages were created from MicroStation design files using in-house developed translation software. Allegheny County's Data Dictionary was used as the base upon which the ArcInfo structure was designed. Each coverage was subjected to review and inspection using ArcMap. Any revisions or corrections were performed in the MicroStation design files. After any corrections were performed, the files were re-translated, re-plotted and re-checked to confirm correct translations. ArcMap was then used to visually check the planimetric data against the digital orthophoto on a tile basis. The final QC step was to merge all tiles to verify the edgematch. Validation was done using MRF. The ESRI tool LOADDATA was used to convert coverages to the final deliverable format, the geodatabase.</procdesc>
