        <procdesc>Using the ALS70 Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system, 31 (Thirty-one) flight lines of high density data, at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.5 meter, were collected for T3GS/PENN State University 0.5M LiDAR (approximately 35 square miles). Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return. Two (2) missions were flown on April 13, 2015. A single airborne global positioning system (GPS) base station was used in support of the LiDAR data acquisition. Fifty three (53) ground control points were surveyed through static methods. The geoid used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric heights was Geoid12A. All data for the task order is referenced to the NAD83 (2011) Pennsylvania State Plane; NAVD88 in U.S. Feet. Airborne GPS data was differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive a smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET). The SBET was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM) and separate last returns. In addition to the LAS deliverables, one layer of coverage was delivered in the DEM IMG format.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The ALS70 calibration and system performance is verified on a periodic basis using Woolpert's calibration range. The calibration range consists of a large building and runway. The edges of the building and control points along the runway have been located using conventional survey methods. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) misalignment angles and horizontal accuracy are calculated by comparing the position of the building edges between opposing flight lines. The scanner scale factor and vertical accuracy is calculated through comparison of LiDAR data against control points along the runway. Field calibration is performed on all flight lines to refine the IMU misalignment angles. IMU misalignment angles are calculated from the relative displacement of features within the overlap region of adjacent (and opposing) flight lines. The raw LiDAR data is reduced using the refined misalignment angles.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Once the data acquisition and GPS processing phases are complete, the LiDAR data was processed immediately to verify the coverage had no voids. The GPS and IMU data was post processed using differential and Kalman filter algorithms to derive a best estimate of trajectory. The quality of the solution was verified to be consistent with the accuracy requirements of the project.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The individual flight lines were inspected to ensure the systematic and residual errors have been identified and removed. Then, the flight lines were compared to adjacent flight lines for any mismatches to obtain a homogenous coverage throughout the project area. The point cloud underwent a classification process to determine bare-earth points and non-ground points utilizing "first and only" as well as "last of many" LiDAR returns. This process determined Default  points (Class 1), Bare-Earth points (Class 2), Low Vegetation (Class 3), Medium Vegetation (Class 4), High Vegetation (Class 5), Buildings (Class 6), Noise (Class 7), Bridges (Class 13), Overlap Default (Class 17), Overlap Ground (Class 18) . The bare-earth (Class 2 - Ground) LiDAR points underwent a manual QA/QC step to verify that artifacts have been removed from the bare-earth surface. The surveyed ground control points are used to perform the accuracy checks and statistical analysis of the LiDAR dataset.</procdesc>
