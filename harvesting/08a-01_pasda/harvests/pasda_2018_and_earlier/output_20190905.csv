Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.

This tree canopy change data set consists of three classes: no change, gain, and loss. No change polygons are those in which the tree canopy remained the same between the two time periods. Gain polygons are those in which tree canopy increased between the two time periods. Loss polygons are those in which tree canopy decrease between the two time periods. 2010 tree canopy can be calculated by adding the \u201cno change\u201d and loss classes. Tree canopy for 2015 can be calculated by adding the \u201cno change\u201d and \u201cgain\u201d classes.Several data sets were used to map tree canopy change. The starting point was the 2010 high-resolution land cover data set developed for Allegheny County. Change was then mapped using leaf-off lidar data collected in 2006, 4-band leaf-on National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data collected in 2010, leaf off lidar data collected in 2015, and 4-band leaf-on NAIP data collected in 2015. All four data sets were integratedinto an object-based image analysis system (OBIA), which a rule-based expert system. A combination of segmentation, classification, and morphology algorithms were employed to determine if tree canopy had changed between the two time periods. The data set was then manually edited at a scale of 1:5000. The main factors determining change were a decrease in height, indicating tree removal, as identified by the lidar, and the change in the spectral characteristics, as identified in the aerial imagery. There were spatial misalignment issues between all four of the data sets. As a result, very fine scale changes at the edges of tree canopy could not be determined. The data set can thus be considered to be slightly biased towards tree canopy loss, and fine-scale tree canopy gains could not be determined. Most of the gain identified is not new growth, but rather canopy from trees that were too small to be detected in the original 2010 mapping.The incorporation of newer lidar data enabled a revisit of the original 2010 tree canopy mapping. The 2015 lidar data was substantially higher quality than the 2006 lidar data used for the 2010 high-resolution land cover mapping project. This enabled errors of omission and commission in the original 2010 tree canopy mapping to be corrected. Examples include shrubby areas in 2010 falsely classified as tree canopy and tall trees that were not clearly visible in the data used to map tree canopy in 2010. This data set should be considered to be the most accurate depiction of tree canopy for both the 2010 and 2015 time periods.',)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=AlleghenyCounty_TreeCanopyChange_2010_2015.xml',)"

Important selection criteria for Natural Heritage Areas are the existence of habitat for plants and animals of special concern, the existence of uncommon or especially important natural communities, and the size and landscape context of a site containing good quality natural features. Large areas and areas that are minimally disturbed by development provide the backbone that links habitats and allows plants and animals to shift and move across sizable portions of the landscape. Core Habitat areas are intended to identify the essential habitat of the species of concern or natural community that can absorb very little activity or disturbance without substantial impact to the natural features. Polygons are based on aerial photo interpretation, field surveys, and existing PNDI data and were delineated by the ecologists on-screen using ArcView (ESRI, Inc., Version 3.3, 8x, and 9x) with the 1:24,000 scale USGS Digital Raster Graphics and/or Digital Aerial Photography images as a background.

The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code.

Ancillary data sources such as LiDAR-derived breaklines for roads and hydrology were used to augment the land-cover mapping. This land-cover dataset is considered current based on data of acquisition for the leaf-on orthoimagery. Land-cover class assignment was accomplished using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:3000 and all observable errors were corrected.This dataset was developed to support land-cover mapping and modeling initiatives in Commonwealth of Pennsylvannia.
