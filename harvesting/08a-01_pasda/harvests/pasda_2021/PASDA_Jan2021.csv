The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to a consistent datum, edge-match, fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams, recast the data to a consistent geographic projection and convert all elevation values to decimal meters as a consistent unit of measure. NED has a resolution of one-third arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for much of the conterminous United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico in a NAD83 datum. There is a resolution of two arc-seconds for Alaska and the datum is NAD27. NED at 10 meters is created using the same methods outlined above with the source data being mostly the 10m DEMs. DEMs at 5 meters, 1/3 arc-second, and 1/9 arc-second maps are also used where available. In some cases, the 10m NED is resampled from LIDAR or created using aerial photography. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. Artifact removal greatly improves the quality of the slope, shaded-relief, and synthetic drainage information that can be derived from the elevation data. Geospatial elevation data are used by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping, and visualization applications. NRCS has elected to ONLY serve NED 10 which is 10 meter or better and not NED 10 which was resampled from 30 meter. NRCS also serves the maps in a UTM projection.

The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative, with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps.

These locations are provided for informational purposes only and should not be sole means of decision making and are in no way a substitute for actual on the ground observation. In 1859, the United States first commercial oil well was drilled in Venango County, Pennsylvania. In the 150 years subsequent to this, an unknown number of oil and gas wells have been drilled in the state. A current estimate by the Independent Petroleum Association of America places that number at approximately 325,000. Of those 325,000 wells, over 200,000 are still unaccounted for. As these wells are found and verified, they are cataloged in the Department of Environmental Protections (DEP) Abandoned and Orphan Well database to facilitate plugging. There are currently over 8,200 wells listed in this database (2013). With so many unknown oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania and the environmental threats that they pose, identification remains a vital component of DEPs Oil and Gas Program. Currently, the DEP, Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and geo-referencing. These maps, which vary in age, not only contain information on historic mine locations, but also oil and gas locations. Through collaboration between the Bureau of Mining Programs and the Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management, potential oil and gas well locations were assembled using three mine map collections. These collections include the WPA mine map collection, Ksheets collection, and the Hsheets collection. From these sources, over 30,000 potential historic oil and gas well locations were derived. The Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management is constantly looking for historic sources to help locate oil and gas wells in the state that remain unaccounted for. This particular dataset was created using georeferenced mine maps of various/unknown accuracy and various/unknown coordinate systems to various base maps, including but not limited to USGS topographic maps and PAMAP aerial photography.

The members of this regional body - the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) - include the four basin state governors and the Division Engineer, North Atlantic Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who serves as the federal representative. Commission programs include water quality protection, water supply allocation, regulatory review (permitting), water conservation initiatives, watershed planning, drought management, flood loss reduction, and recreation. Much of the new drilling interest taking place in northeastern Pennsylvania and southern New York is targeted at reaching the natural gas found in the Marcellus Shale formation, which underlies about 36 percent of the Delaware River Basin. Because the Marcellus Shale is considered a tight geologic formation, natural gas deposits were not previously thought to be practically and economically mineable using traditional techniques.

These atlas sheets were produced from 9x9"" aerial photos. The imagery dates from the years 1959, 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, & 1995. The 1959s and 1965s primarily cover the urbanized portion of the DVRPC region (the DVRPC region is made up of nine counties: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer in New Jersey). Subsequent years provide full coverage of the region, minus the occasional missing scan. In order to increase the efficiency of using the historical aerial imagery, the sheets were scanned into TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files. Each TIFF file ranges between 35- 40MB in size. Unlike DVRPC more recent aerial imagery (2000 and later), the historical aerials are not orthorectified or orthocorrected. In other words, they are simply aerial images with no spatial reference or uniform scale. Through the process of georeferencing, the scanned images can be assigned a spatial reference which will enable them to be used more readily in a GIS environment. That said, georeferencing is not orthorectifying or orthocorrecting. What it does allow is for the scan to be displayed relative to other spatially referenced GIS layers. A georeferenced scan does not have the properties of an actual orthoimage. Whereas an orthoimage can be used for making accurate measurements, a georeferenced image cannot, as it does not have the spatial accuracy and uniform scale of an orthoimage. ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/dvrpc/DVRPC_Historical_Aerials/Indexes/DVRPC_Historical_Aerial_Index_Maps.pdf https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/TileIndex/",85517772-912f-4ba1-b245-145e79bc0797,,1959 - 1995,[1959 TO 1995],1959,Public,,English,"DVRPC Historic Digital Imagery (multiple years) 1959, 1965-1995: Pennsylvania",85517772-912f-4ba1-b245-145e79bc0797,,,FALSE,Image,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,Pennsylvania,"41.1172,-77.6053",Aerial imagery,,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1148,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1148,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=DVRPC_HistoricImagery59_00.html

The analysis was done by first overlaying the stream shapefile on the orthophotos. Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added. Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile. The canopy coverage percentage was interpreted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement. At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none). - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream. - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. The threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft. If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines. Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline. In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides. Ponds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis. Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value. Edits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious.

The project addressed the meaning, form, and function of public space and nature in Allegheny County, PA, U.S.A. This is the region that encompasses the former steel industry capital of the United States, Pittsburgh PA, U.S.A. 3 Rivers 2nd Nature focused upon the three major rivers; the Allegheny, the Monongahela, and the Ohio Rivers, as well as the streams and subwatersheds. This five-year project revisited questions of nature and post-industrial public space, first addressed on the Nine Mile Run Greenway Project. The focus of the work is research to benefit the public realm, applied as strategic knowledge with accompanying outreach programs intended to enable creative public advocacy and change. The 3 Rivers 2nd Nature conducted integrative analysis and instrumental planning based upon the rigorous field studies that began in the year 2000. The work effort focused upon partnerships to accomplish interdisciplinary analysis, spatial mapping, and concept design within and among specific communities. The work culminated with an ecological design plan and a water quality policy report that analyzed alternatives for ongoing water quality sampling. Finally, the project team has organized the ""Monongahela Conferences"" and the subsequent 2005 ""Groundworks"" exhibition (October 2005) to examine the artist's role in social and environmental change.",5fa7a2d3-aed5-410f-9a64-c4de703967e1,,2006,[2006 TO 2006],2006,Public,,English,"Landscape Ecology and Green Infrastructure: Allegheny County, Pennsylvania",5fa7a2d3-aed5-410f-9a64-c4de703967e1,,,FALSE,Dataset,Carnegie Mellon University,Pennsylvania,"41.1172,-77.6053",Geospatial data,,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1251,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1251,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=3Rivers_Data%2520.html

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties.

CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD.

Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen. The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file. GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.

Ancillary data sources included GIS data (building footprints, road polygons, and hydrography) provided by City of Philadelphia. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2008. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.

Sitler under the supervision of G.W.White, 1959, Bulletin G-32, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. The original map was published at a scale of 1:125,000. Three counties are fully covered by these deposits and mapped (Crawford, Erie, and Mercer); five more are partially covered and mapped (Beaver, Butler, Lawrence, Warren, and Venango). This GIS dataset shows the areal distribution of 14 distinct glacial deposits from the Pleistocene Epoch and Recent stream alluvium and/or bedrock exposures. All mapping activity and lithologic interpretations were made by the original authors of the map (Shepps et al., 1959); the authors of this electronic geospatial resource (Shaffer et al., 2005) have only provided digital transfer of the map features and attributes and documentation of the process. Purpose: This dataset identifies the distribution of surficial unconsolidated sediments (glacial deposits and stream alluvium) in northwestern PA.

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen. The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file. GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar. Users do not have to install this plug-in to view GeoPDF files.",4ea99d01-b52d-48fe-a635-3638f4482da1,,2014,[2014 TO 2014],2014,Public,,English,USGS Geopdfs for New Jersey,4ea99d01-b52d-48fe-a635-3638f4482da1,,,FALSE,Dataset,State of Pennsylvania,New Jersey,"40.143,-74.7311",Maps,United States Geological Survey (USGS),http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1602,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1602,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=USGS_GEOpdf2014.html

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Pennsylvania. This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

More than two thousand dedicated birdwatchers completed surveys of birds across the state from 2004 to 2009. The data amassed reveal the distribution of each species and show changes in distribution since the publication of the first Atlas. The core results of the project are the distribution maps. In fact, up to three maps per species show in fine detail the current distribution of all breeding birds based on the second Atlas, changes in distribution since the first Atlas, and, for more than one hundred species, their density across Pennsylvania.The field project was based at Powdermill Nature Reserve, environmental research center of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Rector, Pennsylvania. Bob Mulvihill and Mike Lanzone were project co-coordinators. Following the recommendations of the North American Ornithological Atlas Committee, the basic survey unit was the block, defined as one-sixth of a standard U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map, of which 4,937 were identified for survey coverage. Local coordination was provided by volunteer Regional Coordinators, who provided the foundation for organizing fieldwork. Eventually, 83 individuals served as Regional Coordinators (see the list under the Credits tab).Breeding bird atlases employ a set of codes to record the behaviors associated with nesting activity, ranging from the simplest detection by sight or sound, through confirmation of active nests and fledged young. Birds observed in breeding habitat, and within their particular breeding season, were placed in one of four categories based on breeding evidence \u2014 observations outside breeding habitat, or Possible, Probable, or Confirmed breeding \u2014 with a two-letter code used for confirmed breeding evidence and single letter codes for all other categories (See Project Methods \u2013 Breeding Codes). The second Atlas did not recommend undue effort to confirm breeding of common species, because it was believed that the field time could be better spent compiling species lists from multiple blocks. Obtaining confirmed breeding evidence was stressed for species identified in a particular conservation or priority category or for species simply rare or unexpected within the block.",12f51950-b386-4931-b843-2a8dd48646d9,,2016,[2016 TO 2016],2016,Public,,English,Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas - Second: Pennsylvania,12f51950-b386-4931-b843-2a8dd48646d9,,,FALSE,Dataset,State of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,"41.1172,-77.6053",Geospatial data,Pennsylvania Game Commission,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=233,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=233,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=PABBA_2nd.html

After they move to this status, these products are no longer official and binding under the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program). However, Historic Products may serve as valuable reference information and provide a record of an area\'s changing flood risks over time. They are made available on the Map Service Center for these purposes. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) that were issued to amend Historic Products when they were still effective are also listed here. A LOMC is a formal document that communicates an official modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMCs are issued in place of a physical alteration and re-publication of the map. Regulatory Mapping Products Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - The official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. Full FIRM panels are quite large (36\' x 25.875\'), so most users will prefer to print out a smaller selected portion called a FIRMette. This can be accomplished by selecting ""View"" once you have located your FIRM or by using the FIRMette - Desktop application. Flood Insurance Study (FIS) - A compilation and presentation of flood risk data for specific watercourses, lakes and coastal flood hazard areas within a community. The FIS report provides a detailed written account of a flood hazard mapping study and its findings. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) - Documents, including different types of Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) and Letters of Map Amendment (LOMA), that are issued by FEMA to revise or amend the flood hazard information shown on the FIRM without requiring the FIRM to be physically revised and republished. In addition, FEMA issues a formal determination letter, called a LOMC Revalidation or LOMC-VALID letter - when one or more previously issued LOMCs are found to still be valid during a new flood mapping study of an area.

The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape.

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties.

County-wide karst-feature inventories for fourteen counties (Adams, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and York) were originally released as hard-copy open file reports by the agency. The user of this dataset would be well served to consult one of those reports for specifics on how the inventories were conducted. Data are also provided from incidental reports of karst features as well as partial or cursory inventories in eight additional counties (Bedford, Blair, Clinton, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lycoming, and Mifflin). The majority of these features were identified on contact prints of USDA, USGS, and other aerial photography. Photo locations were then transferred to paper copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles where the coordinates for the locations were determined using a constantly evolving array of technologies from mylar overlay grids, through early proprietary mapping software and more recently with GIS and GPS technology. . Some features in urbanized areas were identified via questionnaires that were sent to the municipalities in the counties being inventoried. The locations of surface mines and cave entrances were garnered from historical geological publications. Locations of historical iron mines and other activities often associated with karst features were garnered from historical geological publications. Field surveys were undertaken to establish protocol for future mapping efforts as well as to verify the field presence of interpreted features. Field verified sites are not identified in the data set. Karst features change considerably over time. Sinkholes become filled or subsidence is repaired. One of the motivations for the karst inventory program was the rapid development taking place in many of the counties where karst could be a problem.

These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",2e0b64ec-7923-459d-acb4-13b23d430bd2,,2015,[2015 TO 2015],2015,Public,,English,"Cartographic Boundary File, State-County-Census Tract, 1:500,000, 2015 : Pennsylvania",2e0b64ec-7923-459d-acb4-13b23d430bd2,,,FALSE,Dataset,State of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,"41.1172,-77.6053",Geospatial data,United States Census Bureau,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=3113,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=3113,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=cb_2015_42_tract_500k.html

Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.

Twelve land cover classes were mapped:0 - Background1 - Water2 - Emergent Wetlands3 - Tree Canopy4 - Scrub/Shrub5 - Low Vegetation6 - Barren7 - Structures8 - Other Impervious Surfaces9 - Roads10 - Tree Canopy over Structures11 - Tree Canopy over Other Impervious Surfaces12 - Tree Canopy over RoadsThe complete class definitions and standards can be viewed at the link below.http://goo.gl/THacggThe primary sources used to derive this land-cover layer were 2006-2008 leaf-off LiDAR data, 2005-2008 leaf-off orthoimagery, and 2013 leaf-on orthoimagery. Ancillary data sources such as LiDAR-derived breaklines for roads and hydrology were used to augment the land-cover mapping. This land-cover dataset is considered current based on data of acquisition for the leaf-on orthoimagery. Land-cover class assignment was accomplished using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.

The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.

The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Pennsylvania. This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

The data sets were digitized primarily from the artwork used for the 1980 ""Geologic Map of Pennsylvania"" (Berg, T. M., Edmunds, W. E., Geyer, A. R., and others, compilers, 1980, Geologic map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 1, scale 1:250,000) and from source materials used for that map. Many of the source materials had been published as page-sized maps and were digitized from this published paper copy (Berg, T. M., and Dodge, C. M., 1981, Atlas of preliminary geologic quadrangle maps of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 61, scale approx. 1:62,500). The other source materials consist of unpublished and published maps at various scales. It was beyond the scope of the project to incorporate revisions that had been made to the geologic units since the 1980 map was compiled; however, some updates to formational contacts, faults, and dikes, as well as to geologic nomenclature and ages, were incorporated where the revisions could be easily made. The 1980 Pennsylvania state geologic map (Berg and others, 1980) shows the areal distribution of 194 bedrock geologic units. The units range in geologic age from Quaternary to Precambrian and encompass a wide variety of lithologies. The map was compiled and published in a transverse mercator projection at 1:250,000 scale. The two digital data sets include 195 geologic units, which, for the most part, closely correspond to those shown on the 1980 map. The data sets were prepared using ArcInfo software and are provided in a geographic coordinate system (units in decimal degrees). Although it is possible to portray digital data at any scale, the geologic formational contacts, faults, and dikes represented in these data sets are not intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:250,000. The polygon attributes in the data set for geologic contacts and faults include unit number, map symbol, name, age, and three lithology categories that represent the general lithologic makeup of each geologic unit. Each arc (line) in the data set is attributed as one or more of the three general categories of contact, fault, or border. Contact lines are attributed according to the type of contact shown on the 1980 map (solid, dashed, queried, or arbitrary). Fault lines are similarly attributed (solid, dashed, or queried). Borders are attributed as either state boundaries, quadrangle boundaries, or the shoreline of Lake Erie. The data set for dikes consists of arcs attributed with unit number, map symbol, name, age, lithology, and type of dike (solid or dashed). It is anticipated that the digital data sets will be used for a variety of regional or statewide geographic-information-system applications, including water-resource and environmental studies, conservation and ecosystem management, mineral exploration, and regional land use planning and development.",3fd82a01-5b0e-42d9-8507-c707220482a7,,2001,[2001 TO 2001],2001,Public,,English,Bedrock Geology: Pennsylvania,3fd82a01-5b0e-42d9-8507-c707220482a7,,,FALSE,Dataset,State of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,"41.1172,-77.6053",Geospatial data,Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=480,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=480,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=dcnr_bedrockgeology2001.html

Many forest species are influenced by disturbance and either avoid or are less successful in edge forest areas. To create this layer the land cover layer was reclassed to focus forest classes (deciduous forest, mixed forest and coniferous forest) as well as wetlands into one Forest/Natural class and the remaining disturbed classes (urban, suburban, transitional and annual & perennial herbaceous). At this stage, wildlife experts were not convinced that road footprints were captured appropriately since the land cover missed most state and local roads. PA Tiger roads (2009) were used to burn in or force the roads into the land cover layer. Once complete a distance function was used to isolate the first 100 meters into any forest as edge forest.

Sample data were collected from August 1985 to December 1998. Monitoring points were typically homeowner wells, springs, public water supplies, or industrial wells. Locations were chosen to represent regional background conditions within a groundwater basin. Samples were collected by prioritized groundwater basins. Monitoring points represent some of the top 100 priority basins of the 478 groundwater basins. Monitoring points were analyzed for 27 different analytes including pH, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphorus, total organic carbon, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, silica, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, zinc, mercury, and turbidity. Data for alkalinity through silica are in mg/L, whereas values listed for arsenic through mercury are in ug/L. Turbidity is in NTUs. PH is a laboratory pH value. Analyte values listed with the coverage are means. Monitoring points have been sampled up to 34 times. Trend analysis results are included for 474 monitoring points by parameter. The Kendall Tau rank correlation test was used to test for trends in ground water quality over time.

The primary digital orthophotoquad (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75-minutes of latitude by 3.75-minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quad plus The overedge ranges a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The standard, archived digital orthophoto is formatted as four ASCII header records, followed by a series of 8-bit binary image data records. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels ranging from 0 to 255.

The SSURGO data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data.

Sometimes a special soil features layer (point and line features) is included. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management.

Sometimes a special soil features layer (point and line features) is included. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The data set has been provided to Chester County Departments and PASDA as an ArcView shapefile by the County of Chester, Department of Computer and Information Services. The theme has been reprojected to PA Stateplane NAD83 from its original datum in accordance with the base map standards of the County of Chester. The County of Chester serves as the secondary organization in providing this shapefile, as compared to its originator and primary organization, the Natural Resources Conservation Service.",912cfa59-9285-4460-adf7-deaf0e5b8b9a,,1997,[1997 TO 1997],1997,Public,,English,"Prime Agricultural Soils: Chester County, Pennsylvania",912cfa59-9285-4460-adf7-deaf0e5b8b9a,,,FALSE,Dataset,State of Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,"39.9801,-75.7459",Geospatial data,U S Department of Agriculture,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=71,http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=71,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=chestercountyprimeag.html

The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources. This layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them. Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.

Street Centerlines are classified as Primary Road, Secondary Road, Unpaved Road, Limited Access Road, Connecting Road, Jeep Trail, Walkway, Stairway, Alleyway and Unknown. A Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction. A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction. An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel. A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway. A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street. A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together. Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown. Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update. Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature. A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together. Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update. An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads. Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways. A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation. A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature. A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed. Centerlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement. One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement. Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present. For roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement. All attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated. For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR. If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004. The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified. The ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps. Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed. In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads. Street Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset. In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area. Street Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area. The Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field. In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset. When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004. All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values. All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used.

This tree canopy change data set consists of three classes: no change, gain, and loss. No change polygons are those in which the tree canopy remained the same between the two time periods. Gain polygons are those in which tree canopy increased between the two time periods. Loss polygons are those in which tree canopy decrease between the two time periods. 2010 tree canopy can be calculated by adding the \u201cno change\u201d and loss classes. Tree canopy for 2015 can be calculated by adding the \u201cno change\u201d and \u201cgain\u201d classes.Several data sets were used to map tree canopy change. The starting point was the 2010 high-resolution land cover data set developed for Allegheny County. Change was then mapped using leaf-off lidar data collected in 2006, 4-band leaf-on National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data collected in 2010, leaf off lidar data collected in 2015, and 4-band leaf-on NAIP data collected in 2015. All four data sets were integratedinto an object-based image analysis system (OBIA), which a rule-based expert system. A combination of segmentation, classification, and morphology algorithms were employed to determine if tree canopy had changed between the two time periods. The data set was then manually edited at a scale of 1:5000. The main factors determining change were a decrease in height, indicating tree removal, as identified by the lidar, and the change in the spectral characteristics, as identified in the aerial imagery. There were spatial misalignment issues between all four of the data sets. As a result, very fine scale changes at the edges of tree canopy could not be determined. The data set can thus be considered to be slightly biased towards tree canopy loss, and fine-scale tree canopy gains could not be determined. Most of the gain identified is not new growth, but rather canopy from trees that were too small to be detected in the original 2010 mapping.The incorporation of newer lidar data enabled a revisit of the original 2010 tree canopy mapping. The 2015 lidar data was substantially higher quality than the 2006 lidar data used for the 2010 high-resolution land cover mapping project. This enabled errors of omission and commission in the original 2010 tree canopy mapping to be corrected. Examples include shrubby areas in 2010 falsely classified as tree canopy and tall trees that were not clearly visible in the data used to map tree canopy in 2010. This data set should be considered to be the most accurate depiction of tree canopy for both the 2010 and 2015 time periods.",b99f6585-789b-4183-bc6e-bb69929e9dc7,,2010-2016,[2010 TO 2016],2010,Public,Allegheny County -Tree Canopy Change,English,"Tree Canopy Change: Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 2010-2015, 2016",b99f6585-789b-4183-bc6e-bb69929e9dc7,,,FALSE,Dataset,"Allegheny County, Pennsylvania","Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania","40.4877,-80.0166",,,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1235,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1235,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=AlleghenyCounty_TreeCanopyChange_2010_2015.html

County Natural Heritage Inventories focus on areas that are the best examples of ecological resources in a county. Although agricultural lands and open space may be included as part of inventory areas, the emphasis for the designation and delineation of the areas are the ecological values present. Important selection criteria for Natural Heritage Areas are the existence of habitat for plants and animals of special concern, the existence of uncommon or especially important natural communities, and the size and landscape context of a site containing good quality natural features. Large areas and areas that are minimally disturbed by development provide the backbone that links habitats and allows plants and animals to shift and move across sizable portions of the landscape. Core Habitat areas are intended to identify the essential habitat of the species of concern or natural community that can absorb very little activity or disturbance without substantial impact to the natural features. Polygons are based on aerial photo interpretation, field surveys, and existing PNDI data and were delineated by the ecologists on-screen using ArcView (ESRI, Inc., Version 3.3, 8x, and 9x) with the 1:24,000 scale USGS Digital Raster Graphics and/or Digital Aerial Photography images as a background.

Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines.

It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level.

The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code.

Ancillary data sources such as LiDAR-derived breaklines for roads and hydrology were used to augment the land-cover mapping. This land-cover dataset is considered current based on data of acquisition for the leaf-on orthoimagery. Land-cover class assignment was accomplished using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:3000 and all observable errors were corrected.This dataset was developed to support land-cover mapping and modeling initiatives in Commonwealth of Pennsylvannia.

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Ortho Specification, Version 1.0. The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania South FIPS 3702, US Survey Feet. Orthoimagery data was delivered as 284 individual 0.5-foot (15-centimeter) 1"" = 100\' (1 cm = 12 m) GeoTIFF (uncompressed) 10,000-foot x 10,000-foot (3,048-meter x 3,048-meter) tiles. Ground Conditions: Aerial photography was captured during the winter and spring of 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the imagery data to meet task order specifications and meet horizontal accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 496 QC points throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to assess the horizontal accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data",a98b3c8e-667f-46d2-8369-b38ba25d3d01,,2018,[2018 TO 2018],2018,Public,PEMA Orthoimagery 2018 - York County Mosaic,English,"Orthoimagery Mosaic: York County, Pennsylvania, 2018",a98b3c8e-667f-46d2-8369-b38ba25d3d01,,,FALSE,Dataset,State of Pennsylvania,"York County, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania","41.1172,-77.6053",,Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=5108,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=5108,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=PEMA_YorkCounty_Mosaic2018.html

All attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated. For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR. If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004. The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified. The ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps. Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed. In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads. Street Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset. In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area. Street Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area. The Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field. In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset. When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004. All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values. All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used. In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection. Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range. All new Street Centerlines will have zero (0) for ""SystemID"" and ""UserID"".",33fca28e-a9e9-40b7-94a3-dfc5ec9e35a1,,2018,[2018 TO 2018],2018,Public,"Street Centerlines: Allegheny County, Pennsylvania",English,"Street Centerlines: Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 2018",33fca28e-a9e9-40b7-94a3-dfc5ec9e35a1,,,FALSE,Dataset,"Allegheny County, Pennsylvania","Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania","40.4141,-79.9394",Geospatial data,Allegheny County Division of Computer Services Geographic Information Systems Group,,ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/alleghenycounty/historic,https://btaagdp.org/metadata/08a-01/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx%3ffile=AlleghenyCounty_StreetCenterlines201809.html

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true.

CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding Evaluate damages to natural resources HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act [This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners. Other The Other primary facility kind includes a mixture of various different cleanup sites, no further action sites, and potential sites. This is optional data that the regional offices are not required to maintain. STSP Storage Tank Spill and Prevention Act Releases and/or ruptures from improperly installed or faulty storage tanks contaminate the Commonwealth\'s land and water resources.

The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code.

The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources. This layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them. Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.
