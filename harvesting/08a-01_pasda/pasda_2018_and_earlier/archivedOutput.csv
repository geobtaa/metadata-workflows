HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program.

The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code.

The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources.\r\nThis layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them.  Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.

Street Centerlines are classified as Primary Road, Secondary Road, Unpaved Road, Limited Access Road, Connecting Road, Jeep Trail, Walkway, Stairway, Alleyway and Unknown.\r\n\r\nA Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction.  A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction.  An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel.  A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway.  A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street.  A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together.  Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature.  A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation.  A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature.  A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed.\r\n\r\nCenterlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement.  One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement.  Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present.\r\n\r\nFor roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement.\r\n\r\nAll attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated.  For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR.  If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004.  The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified.\r\n\r\nThe ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps.  Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed.  In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads.\r\nStreet Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset.  In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area.\r\n\r\nStreet Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field.  In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset.  When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004.  All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values.  All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used.  In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection.  Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range.  All new Street Centerlines will have zero (0) for ""SystemID"" and ""UserID"".',)",ftp://ftp.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/alleghenycounty/historic
