Data was created as part of the County's base layer(s) update in the spring of 2004.eData was created for all of Allegheny County.fAll horizontal control is to NGS Second Order Class I accuracy or better and photo control points are reported on the North American Datum (NAD) 1983 U.S. Survey Feet. The aerial photography was captured at a negative scale of 1" = 1,600' and is sufficient to produce mapping at 1" = 200' that conforms to National Mapping Accuracy Standards (NMAS).+/- 5 feetiAll final elevations are referenced to North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988. Orthometric heights utilize GEOID 99. The network adheres to the Federal Geodetic Control Committee Standards (FGCS) guidelines and the final constrained adjustments were made with StarNet Least Squares Adjustment program and are acceptable by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).  aAlleghenyCounty_Spotelev2006.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.1.0.722.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7aelevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aAllegheny County. 0aPittsburgh. 0aSouthwest Pennsylvania.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
