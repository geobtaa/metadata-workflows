See the PAMAP Technical Proposal dated January 11, 2006 for further QA/QC procedures.dAll files are inspected by the Production Manager to ensure that they conform to the specified file naming conventions, all files load in their correct geographic position, all files conform to the project specifications for file standard and content.eAll files are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or misplacement exists in the data. The files have been checked to ensure that the boundary and the content has been covered in its entirety.fThe horizontal accuracy standard follows the NSSDA-1998 standard. The maximum permissible RMSE for 95% of the horizontal check points for the mapping product is 5 feet or better.iIndependent accuracy testing was performed by Dewberry using 100 high accuracy quality control checkpoints distributed on near level open bare terrain, high grass, brush, forest and urban terrain. Dewberry uses testing procedures consistent with those specified by both the NSSDA/FEMA and NDEP/ASPRS methods. NSSDA/FEMA: (1) Compared to criteria RMSEz less than or equal to 0.61 ft in Open Terrain, tested 0.34 ft; (2) Compared to criteria Accuracyz less than or equal to 1.19 ft at 95% confidence level, tested 0.67 ft. NDEP/ASPRS: (1) Compared to criteria Fundamental Vertical Accuracy less than or equal to 1.19 ft at 95% confidence level, tested 0.67 ft; (2) Compared to criteria Consolidated Vertical Accuracy less than or equal to 2.38 ft at 95% confidence level, tested 0.90 ft.  apamap_lidar_LAS.  pWhere applicable, all data conforms to the PAMAP Technical Proposal dated January 11, 2006. 7aDEM.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aLiDAR.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aLAS.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCo.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aelevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPennsylvania. 0aCameron County. 0aCentre County. 0aClearfield County. 0aElk County. 0aBlair County. 0aCambria County. 0aJefferson County. 0aIndiana County.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/pamap/documents/index.htm40zConnect to this dataset online.uftp://pamap.pasda.psu.edu/pamap_lidar/cycle1
