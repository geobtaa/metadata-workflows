Analog dodging consists of holding back light from certain areas of the sensitized photographic material to avoid overexposure. The diapositive is inspected to ensure clarity and radiometric uniformity. Diapositive image brightness values are collected with a minimum of image quality manipulation. Image brightness values may deviate from the brightness values of the original images because of image value interpolation during the scanning and rectification processes. Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto with the original unrectified image to determine if the digital orthophoto has the same or better image quality as the original unrectified input image. Slight systematic radiometric differences can be detected between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source photograph capture dates and sun angles along flight lines when the aerial photographs were taken. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.fCompliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data. The elevation data were generated by autocorrelation and manual processes. An RMS value for each tile was calculated based on the photos utilized in the production of the tile by comparing the AT X and Y coordinates. This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in U.S. Survey Feet..324 survey feetThe horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the accuracy of the aerotriangulation and digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM accuracy assessment was achieved by comparing the aerotriangulation-derived elevation with the elevation of the DEM at the same X and Y coordinates. In addition, visual examination was employed to assess all tiles and its relative edge match. All results were examined for consistency and its compliance with the NSSDA accuracy standard.  aPAMAP_cycle1.  aZ/I Imaging Orthopro 4.0, Windows NT/2000 Systems. 7arectified photograph.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7arectified image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7anatural color orthophoto.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aorthoimage.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimage map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aImagery/Base Maps/Earth Cover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
