Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.dGeoTIFFs conform to the specifications set forth in the AeroMetric proposal.eOrthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free.  aLancasterCountyImageryRGB_UTM. 7aImageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
