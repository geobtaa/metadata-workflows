Ninety percent of all elevations from contours will have an accuracy, with respect to true elevation, of within of one half of the contour interval. Ten percent of elevations will not be in error by more than one contour interval. The contours are created from the DTM Feature Dataset. Contours are divided into two (2) main groups; Index Contours and Intermediate Contours. Every fifth contour is classified as an Index Contour and has an elevation interval of a multiple of 25'. Index Contours will be labeled with annotation displaying the elevation of the contour. Contours will not be broken for the placement of the contour label. The contour will be drawn through the label. All other contours are Intermediate Contours. Where appropriate, contours are assigned an additional classification of Hidden, Obscure and Depression. Contours that are created and fall within a building or under a bridge, as a result of creating continuous contours, are coded as Hidden. Obscure Contours are contours that are in an area where the ground is obscured from view on the aerial photography. Obscure Contours will also fall within an Obscure Area Boundary. The Obscure Contours should not be considered accurate as they only give a general representation of the surface of the earth. Depression Contours are closed contours that form a sunken area (depression). Some depressions can cover a large area of land and may not be seen as a depression at a large scale. The contours were created using Bentely SelectCAD software and the following settings: " Import Surface o Thin Surface: Off o Breaklines " Maximum Segment Length: Off " Point Density:Off o Mass Points " Maximum Segment Length:Off " Triangulate Surface o Maximum Length: 0.0 o Filter Tolerance: 0.0 " View Contours: o Display As Linestring o Minimum Area: 500.0 o Clip Contours on Steep Slopes: No o Smooth: OndData was subject to QA/QC process at the time it was created. Data was created as part of the County's base layer(s) update in the spring of 2004.eData was created for all of Allegheny County.fAll horizontal control is to NGS Second Order Class I accuracy or better and photo control points are reported on the North American Datum (NAD) 1983 U.S. Survey Feet. The aerial photography was captured at a negative scale of 1" = 1,600' and is sufficient to produce mapping at 1" = 200' that conforms to National Mapping Accuracy Standards (NMAS).+/- 5 feetiAll final elevations are referenced to North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988. Orthometric heights utilize GEOID 99. The network adheres to the Federal Geodetic Control Committee Standards (FGCS) guidelines and the final constrained adjustments were made with StarNet Least Squares Adjustment program and are acceptable by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).  aAlleghenyCounty_Contours2006.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.1.0.722.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7aelevation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aAllegheny County. 0aPittsburgh. 0aSouthwest Pennsylvania.40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu
