This is to ensure that a particular color will remain consistent thoughout a DRG series. For these raster images derived from the MapTech Historical collection at http://historical.maptech.com, there is no guarantee given for consistent colors. This is due to the fact that images downloaded from the collection as jpegs had a 16 million color resolution, and after being combined, were reduced by an optimal best match method to 256 color (8 bit) depth.dGreat care was taken by eye to seam together the four separate jpeg images that were scanned for each topographic map at library sites. Because of small levels of inaccuracy due to image rotation or scanner operation, there are varying amounts of error at seams where the images line up. As other methods of lining up images automatically through software become available, some of these historical map images may be redone and replaced.  amaptechhistoric2005.  aMicrosoft Windows 2000 Version 5.0 (Build 2195) Service Pack 4; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535.  cObjectIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7araster image.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopographic map.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atopopgraphic quadrangle.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adrg.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7adigital raster graphic.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ahistoric.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aimageryBaseMapsEarthCover.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPennsylvania.40zConnect to this dataset online.uftp://www.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/maptech_historic/
