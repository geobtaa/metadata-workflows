					The specifications require that only raw Nonvegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) be computed for raw lidar point cloud swath files.

						The raw NVA was tested using 91 independent survey points located in open terrain. The surveyed checkpoints were distributed throughout the project area and surveyed using GNSS procedures and methodologies that provide reliable and consistent results to meet the project's accuracy requirements. Please see the "Survey Accuracy Requirements" and "Field Methodology" sections in the Survey Report for more information. Elevations from the unclassified lidar surface were measured for the x,y location of each check point. Elevations interpolated from the unclassified lidar surface were then compared to the elevation values of the surveyed control. The RMSEz was computed to be 0.04 meters and AccuracyZ to be 0.085 meters.

			Lidar Pre-Processing: Airborne GPS and IMU data were merged to develop a Single Best Estimate (SBET) of the lidar system trajectory for each lift. Lidar ranging data were initially calibrated using previous best parameters for this instrument and aircraft. Relative calibration was evaluated using advanced plane-matching analysis and parameter corrections derived. This was repeated iteratively until residual errors between overlapping swaths, across all project lifts, was reduced to 2 cm or less. Data were then block adjusted to match surveyed calibration control. Raw data NVA were checked using independently surveyed checkpoints. Swath overage points were identified and tagged within each swath file.</procdesc>

			Lidar Post-Processing: The calibrated and controlled lidar swaths were processed using automatic point classification routines in proprietary software. These routines operate against the entire collection (all swaths, all lifts), eliminating character differences between files. Data were then distributed as virtual tiles to experienced lidar analysts for localized automatic classification, manual editing, and peer-based QC checks. Supervisory QC monitoring of work in progress and completed editing ensured consistency of classification character and adherence to project requirements across the entire project area.
			All classification tags are stored in the original swath files.
			After completion of classification and final QC approval, the NVA and VVA for the project are calculated. Sample areas for each land cover type present in the project area were extracted and forwarded to the client, along with the results of the accuracy tests. Upon acceptance, the complete classified lidar swath files were delivered to the client.</procdesc>

			Classified LAS Processing: The bare earth surface is then manually reviewed to ensure correct classification on the Class 2 (Ground) points.  After the bare-earth surface is finalized, it is then used to generate all hydro-breaklines through heads-up digitization.
			All ground (ASPRS Class 2) LiDAR data inside of the Lake Pond and Double Line Drain hydro flattening breaklines were then classified to water (ASPRS Class 9) using TerraScan macro functionality.  A buffer of 1 meter was also used around each hydro-flattened feature to classify these ground (ASPRS Class 2) points to Ignored ground (ASPRS Class 10).  All Lake Pond Island and Double Line Drain Island features were checked to ensure that the ground (ASPRS Class 2) points were reclassified to the correct classification after the automated classification was completed.  All bridge decks were classified to Class 17.
			All overlap data was processed through automated functionality provided by TerraScan to classify the overlapping flight line data to approved classes by USGS.  The overlap data was identified using the Overlap Flag, per LAS 1.4 specifications.
			All data was manually reviewed and any remaining artifacts removed using functionality provided by TerraScan and TerraModeler.  Global Mapper us used as a final check of the bare earth dataset.  GeoCue was then used to create the deliverable industry-standard LAS files for both the All Point Cloud Data and the Bare Earth.  Quantum Spatial proprietary software was used to perform final statistical analysis of the classes in the LAS files, on a per tile level to verify final classification metrics and full LAS header information.</procdesc>

			        Hydro Flattened Breakline Processing: 
			        Class 2 LiDAR was used to create a bare earth surface model.  The surface model was then used to heads-up digitize 2D breaklines of inland streams and rivers with a 30 meter nominal width and Inland Ponds and Lakes of 2 acres or greater surface area.
			        Elevation values were assigned to all Inland Ponds and Lakes, Inland Pond and Lake Islands, Inland Stream and River Islands, using TerraModeler functionality.
			        Elevation values were assigned to all Inland streams and rivers using Quantum Spatial proprietary software.
			        All ground (ASPRS Class 2) LiDAR data inside of the collected inland breaklines were then classified to water (ASPRS Class 9) using TerraScan macro functionality.  A buffer of 1 meter was also used around each hydro-flattened feature.  These points were moved from ground (ASPRS Class 2) to Ignored Ground (ASPRS Class 10).
			        The breakline files were then translated to ESRI File-Geodatabase format using ESRI conversion tools.</procdesc>

			        Hydro Flattened Raster DEM Process: 
			        Class 2 LiDAR in conjunction with the hydro breaklines were used to create a 1 meter Raster DEM.  Using automated scripting routines within ArcMap, an ERDAS Imagine IMG file was created for each tile.  Each surface is reviewed using Global Mapper to check for any surface anomalies or incorrect elevations found within the surface.

    <idPurp>Classified LAS files are used to show the manually reviewed bare earth surface.  This allows the user to create Breaklines and Raster DEMs. 
				The purpose of these lidar data was to produce high accuracy 3D hydro-flattened Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a 1-meter cell size.
				These raw lidar point cloud data were used to create classified lidar LAS files, 3D breaklines, and hydro-flattened DEMs as necessary.</idPurp>
    <idAbs>&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Geographic Extent: Delaware Valley, covering approximately 3260 square miles over the Philadelphia Metro area, comprised of of 8 contiguous counties located in the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Dataset Description: Delaware Valley 2015 LiDAR project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of LIDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM Zone 18, NAD83 (2011), meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 25 individual 1500 meter X 1500 meter tiles for the pilot (3752 individual 1500 meter X 1500 meter tiles for the entire project area), Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1500 meter X 1500 meter tile schema, and Breaklines in Esri shapefile format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring of 2015, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established 76 calibration control points in order to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the Delaware Valley project area. The accuracy of the data was checked with 91 NVA points and 70 VVA points (161 total QC checkpoints).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</idAbs>
