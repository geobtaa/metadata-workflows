        <horizpar>The digital GeoPDF version of the historical map was georeferenced with a methodology that preserves, but does not exceed, the accuracy of the original map. The historical map product was compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) of the era when the map was originally published.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The GeoPDFs for the scanned Historical Quadrangles are produced using the following steps. Historical Quadrangles are scanned typically at 600 PPI (minimum of 400 PPI). Metadata is collected from the information printed in the map collar. Scanned TIFF images are georeferenced to the original map datum, and reprojected to the original map projection. The final GeoPDF file is generated using TerraGo Publisher for Raster software. To support the use of the GeoPDF file in the U.S. Army Geospatial Center GeoPDF seamless viewing tool, neatline coordinates are added to the GeoPDF header file. Last, an FGDC compliant XML metadata file is generated and attached to the GeoPDF. Note that GeoPDF is a copyrighted format, with implementation rights held exclusively by TerraGo Technologies. Any use of trade, product, or firm names in this publication is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.</procdesc>
