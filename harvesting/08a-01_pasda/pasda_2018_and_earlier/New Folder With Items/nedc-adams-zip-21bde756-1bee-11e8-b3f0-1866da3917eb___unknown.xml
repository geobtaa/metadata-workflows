A plan for assessing the overall accuracy of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) based on independent high-accuracy geodetic control is currently under development. The accuracy described will be in the terms used in the FGDC Content Standards for Framework Land Elevation Data . Accuracy will be determined and reported using the methodology specified in the FGDC National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy.

Until an independent overall assessment of the accuracy of NED is completed, it is best to refer to published information on the accuracy of the source digital elevation models (DEM's) from which NED was assembled. The primary source data were the USGS 7.5-minute (30-meter or 10-meter resolution) DEM's. Gaps in the 7.5-minute DEM coverage were filled with data from USGS 30-minute (2-arc-second resolution) or 1-degree (3-arc-second resolution) DEM's. The USGS Data Users Guide 5 for DEM's (traditionally known as the "blue book"), last published in 1993, contains a general discussion of DEM accuracy and a brief description of the accuracy testing methodology.

The DEM data users guide also describes the classification levels of standard USGS DEM products. The level of a DEM is defined, in part, on the basis of its accuracy.

        <procdesc>USGS identified existing DEM data at the highest available resolution.  The majority is 30-meter 1:24000 scale data with 10-meter data used where available for the conterminous U.S.  Data was projected into geographic decimal degrees and datums were transformed to NAD83 and NAVD88.  Data with a horizontal resolution finer than 30-meters was resampled to 30-meter resolution before merging into the national dataset. All elevation units were converted to decimal meters.  Procedures were applied to correct and/or minimize artifacts found in the source DEM. 1x1 degree tiles were created and edge of 7.5 minute sources were matched.  These 1x1 degree tiles were merged to create two grid files that covered the entire state of Pennsylvania. A more detailed explanation of these processes performed at USGS can be found at: http://gisdata.usgs.gov/NED/default.asp.</procdesc>
