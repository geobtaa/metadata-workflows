"Flood mapping by drones [Cantua Creek, California] {January 2023}]",California--Cantua Creek,"Flood mapping by drones in Cantua Creek, California (January 2023)","Several weeks of storms in January 2023 have caused significant damage across California, with mudslides and flooding resulting in at least 19 dead and widespread damage to infrastructure. Drone experts at GLOBHE have activated drone operators in the region, capturing critical data in most affected areas and making it accessible to all the authorities, NGOs, and volunteers who now scramble to assist.The donated high-quality drone data is available to all entities working to support the region, easily accessible here. The datasets includes one high-resolution orthomosaic and six 360° panoramas to show the impact of floodings in the area.“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the storms and all those who work hard to rescue, repair, and rebuild across the affected areas,” says Napoleon Bergström, COO at GLOBHE.As a global leader in connecting local drone operators with organizations in need of accurate drone data, GLOBHE works together with leading organizations to prevent and respond to natural disasters, often in hard-to-access areas across the world.“Access to high-quality imaging can give critical data on damage to housing, infrastructure, and nature, and make it easier to make the right decisions and help those affected,” says Napoleon Bergström, COO at GLOBHE. “That is why our team will work hard to provide this data.”
From January 24, the data of affected areas in California is freely available here.About GLOBHE:
GLOBHE is leading organizations to make better decisions through drone data. Through a single platform, the company offers organizations accurate and actionable drone data from anywhere in the world. GLOBHE's platform is a leading curated marketplace connecting local drone operators with organizations with the need for drone data of the highest quality.

Age and sex structures [United States of America],United States of America,United States of America - Age and sex structures,"WorldPop produces different types of gridded population count datasets, depending on the methods used and end application. 
Please make sure you have read our Mapping Populations overview page before choosing and downloading a dataset.A description of the modelling methods used for age and sex structures can be found inTatem et al and 
Pezzulo et al. Details of the input population count datasets used can be found here, and age/sex structure proportion datasets here.Both top-down 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' versions of the datasets are available, and the differences between the two methods are outlined 
here. The  datasets represent the outputs from a project focused on construction of consistent 100m resolution population count datasets for all countries of the World structured by male/female and 5-year age classes (plus a <1 year class). These efforts necessarily involved some shortcuts for consistency. The unconstrained datasets are available for each year from 2000 to 2020.
The constrained datasets are only available for 2020 at present, given the time periods represented by the building footprint and built settlement datasets used in the mapping.

However, if You fail to comply with     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License     terminate automatically.b.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so     will not terminate this Public License.d.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and     conditions.c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the     Licensor.d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.=======================================================================Creative Commons is not a party to its publiclicenses.

"Flood mapping by drones [Merced, California] {January 2023}",California--Merced,"Flood mapping by drones in Merced, California (January 2023)","Several weeks of storms in January 2023 have caused significant damage across California, with mudslides and flooding resulting in at least 19 dead and widespread damage to infrastructure. Drone experts at GLOBHE have activated drone operators in the region, capturing critical data in most affected areas and making it accessible to all the authorities, NGOs, and volunteers who now scramble to assist.The donated high-quality drone data is available to all entities working to support the region, easily accessible here. The datasets includes one high-resolution orthomosaic and six 360° panoramas to show the impact of floodings in the area.“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the storms and all those who work hard to rescue, repair, and rebuild across the affected areas,” says Napoleon Bergström, COO at GLOBHE.As a global leader in connecting local drone operators with organizations in need of accurate drone data, GLOBHE works together with leading organizations to prevent and respond to natural disasters, often in hard-to-access areas across the world.“Access to high-quality imaging can give critical data on damage to housing, infrastructure, and nature, and make it easier to make the right decisions and help those affected,” says Napoleon Bergström, COO at GLOBHE. “That is why our team will work hard to provide this data.” From January 24, the data of affected areas in California is freely available here.About GLOBHE:
GLOBHE is leading organizations to make better decisions through drone data. Through a single platform, the company offers organizations accurate and actionable drone data from anywhere in the world. GLOBHE's platform is a leading curated marketplace connecting local drone operators with organizations with the need for drone data of the highest quality.
