This version supersedes all previously dated versions. Updates are made to the shapefile as new information becomes available, and periodically updated maps are posted to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission website. A range map is a generalized representation of the distribution of a species. A species might occur anywhere within a mapped range in which there is suitable habitat. These maps show current ranges rather than historical ranges. Thus an area in which a given species formerly occurred is not included if there is a high degree of confidence on the part of NGPC biologists that the species no longer occurs there. Species, particularly those highly mobile such as birds, may occur outside of their range in locations in which the species is generally described as 'accidental' or 'vagrant.' Range maps do not include such locations. Species may also occur outside the range if the range has changed since the time it was last updated.</span>", "keyword": ["Biota", "Nebraska", "Species Ranges", "At-Risk", "tschizzle"], "issued": "2020-12-31T17:44:00.000Z", "modified": "2022-02-22T14:49:40.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "State of Nebraska"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "jeff.timm@Nebraska.gov_nebraska", "hasEmail": "mailto:nebraskamap.info@nebraska.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-104.2195,39.8913,-95.0916,43.1123", "license": "<span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>In order to use these data appropriately, users should understand the nature of a range map. A species might be expected to occur anywhere within a mapped range in which there is suitable habitat. These ranges were drawn and edited with the input of biological experts and using locations of documented occurrences for reference. Users should recognize that no surveys have been conducted near the edges of ranges in Nebraska to determine the exact extent of the range. Boundaries should be considered approximate. Users should furthermore recognize that a given species may sometimes occur outside of its range. By their nature, range maps are approximations and are not intended for use at scales larger than originally created. The original scale at which these maps were produced was approximately 1:3,000,000.

Product: This copy of the contours layer was clipped for Douglas County with a 400-ft buffer and re-projected to NE State Plane NAD83 Feet on 1.24.20187 by DCGIS (MS). Contours were collected to represent the elevation of the area. These contours were accompanied by hydro-flattened Bare Earth DEMs and breaklines. Geographic Extent: AOI was located in Eastern Nebraska over Douglas, Sarpy, and Lancaster Counties. The area of interest covered approximately 1,789 square miles. Dataset Description: NE Nebraska Urban Area Lidar_2016 QL2 Lidar project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.70 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), Nebraska State Plane (FIPS 2600), U.S. Survey Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Feet. Lidar data was delivered as; flightline-extent raw LAS v1.4 swaths, classified point cloud LAS v1.4 files formatted to 2,380 individual 5000' x 5000' tiles in NAD83 (2011) Nebraska State Plane (FIPS 2600). Derivatives were produced as tiled; Bare Earth Surface DEMs, Digital Surface Models, Intensity Images; all tiled to the same 5000\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 x 5000\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in winter of 2016/17 by Aerial Services, Inc. (ASI), while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established a total of 33 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. Additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected (76 NVA points and 55 VVA points) and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data. <br /><br /> <b>Questions?</b> <a href='https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/eba98bceda6f44fd93d5a23c7c22274c?hide=field:source_website' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Contact Us</a>", "keyword": ["Contours", "Elevation", "LiDAR", "OpenData", "Douglas County NE", "Omaha", "US-NE", "NebraskaMAP", "DOGIS"], "issued": "2018-01-25T18:10:18.000Z", "modified": "2021-12-10T17:58:49.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Douglas County"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Nataliya2", "hasEmail": "mailto:gis@douglascounty-ne.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-96.4848,41.1942,-95.8637,41.3915", "license": "Douglas County ('Douglas'), the City of Omaha ('Omaha'), as well as their respective employees, agents, and personnel, MAKE NO WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR WARRANTY FOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA AND INFORMATION CONTAINED ON THIS MAPPING WEBSITE.

There are two main ecoregion maps for the United States, one developed by the U.S. Forest Service (Bailey et al. 1994) and the other developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Omernik et al. 1987). For the Natural Legacy Project we delineated ecoregions using primarily Level III ecoregion lines from Ecoregions of Nebraska and Kansas (Chapman et al. 2001), which was a joint project of the USFS and EPA to blend the two systems. However, we used Bailey's Section level line to delineate the western boundary of tallgrass prairie south of the Sandhills since this was a better fit with Kaul and Rolfsmeier's (1993) map of the native vegetation of Nebraska.</span></p></div></div></div>", "keyword": ["ecoregions", "ecology", "plant communities"], "issued": "2021-10-14T14:42:55.000Z", "modified": "2021-10-14T14:45:37.501Z", "publisher": {"name": "Nebraska Game & Parks Commission"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NGPC.GISAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:devarsi.majumder@nebraska.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-103.9706,39.8915,-95.1307,43.0468", "license": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>These data are a very rough approximation of reality and are designed for visualization rather than analysis.

The following summary of how BULs were defined is copied directly from Chapter 3, page 15 of that Schneider et al 2005: &quot;One of the goals of the Natural Legacy Project is to identify a set of priority landscapes that, if properly managed, would conserve the majority of Nebraska's biological diversity. These landscapes, which we are calling Biologically Unique Landscapes, were selected based on known occurrences of at-risk species and ecological communities. In addition to at-risk species, these landscapes support a broad array of common species. The following sections describe the approach we used to identify the at-risk species, ecological communities and biologically unique landscapes.&quot; Initial efforts to implement the Natural Legacy Plan focused on nine Biologically Unique Landscapes (BULs) that had 'Flagship Initiatives' underway. Flagship Initiatives are coordinated efforts that include conservation actions on private and public lands, education and outreach, and monitoring and research. As part of the revision of the Natural Legacy Plan in 2010, six boundaries were modified. The changes were approved in 2011.", "keyword": ["BUL", "Landscape", "NGPC", "Biota", "Nebraska Natural Heritage Program", "environment"], "issued": "2017-02-28T16:41:41.000Z", "modified": "2019-05-09T13:52:07.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Nebraska Game & Parks Commission"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NGPC.GISAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:devarsi.majumder@nebraska.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-104.0722,39.9704,-95.271,43.029", "license": "<div>There are no restrictions on the use and distribution of data provided in this map or service.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Information displayed on this map is furnished as a public service by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and is intended to be used for reference only.
