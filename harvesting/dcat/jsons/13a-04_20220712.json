The following description of the ecoregion layer and the sources of data used to create it were copied directly from Appendix 10 (page 246) of that document: Ecoregions are relatively large units of land and water delineated by the biotic and abiotic factors (e.g. climate, topography, geology, vegetation) that regulate the structure and function of the ecosystems within them. There are two main ecoregion maps for the United States, one developed by the U.S. Forest Service (Bailey et al. 1994) and the other developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Omernik et al. 1987). For the Natural Legacy Project we delineated ecoregions using primarily Level III ecoregion lines from Ecoregions of Nebraska and Kansas (Chapman et al. 2001), which was a joint project of the USFS and EPA to blend the two systems. However, we used Bailey's Section level line to delineate the western boundary of tallgrass prairie south of the Sandhills since this was a better fit with Kaul and Rolfsmeier's (1993) map of the native vegetation of Nebraska.</span></p></div></div></div>", "keyword": ["ecoregions", "ecology", "plant communities"], "issued": "2021-10-14T14:42:55.000Z", "modified": "2021-10-14T14:45:37.501Z", "publisher": {"name": "Nebraska Game & Parks Commission"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NGPC.GISAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:devarsi.majumder@nebraska.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-103.9706,39.8915,-95.1307,43.0468", "license": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>These data are a very rough approximation of reality and are designed for visualization rather than analysis.
