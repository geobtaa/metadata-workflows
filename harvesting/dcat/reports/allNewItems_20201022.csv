,Base Flow of Michigan Streams,"This data set provides estimates of the groundwater contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream-flow gauging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gauging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",English,"Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy",State of Michigan,Geospatial data,,Michigan|Hydrology|EGLE|Groundwater,2020-07-31T12:03:48.000Z,,,,Michigan,"-167.0934,69.4683,173.9906,76.1809",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/404e8b090ce64ac1a41ea481d0745af2_3,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/404e8b090ce64ac1a41ea481d0745af2_3.zip,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,,,404e8b090ce64ac1a41ea481d0745af2_3,Michigan State,06a-01,06a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE
,National Wetlands Inventory,"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

,Base Flow of Michigan Streams,"This data set provides estimates of the groundwater contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream-flow gauging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gauging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",English,"Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy",State of Michigan,Geospatial data,,Michigan|Hydrology|EGLE|Groundwater,2020-07-31T12:03:48.000Z,,,,Michigan,"-167.0934,69.4683,173.9906,76.1809",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/404e8b090ce64ac1a41ea481d0745af2_3,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/404e8b090ce64ac1a41ea481d0745af2_3.zip,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,,,404e8b090ce64ac1a41ea481d0745af2_3,Michigan State,06a-01,06a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE
,National Wetlands Inventory,"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters.

,Landslide Inventory – Undated,"This dataset includes areas within Hennepin County that likely experienced landslide activity in historic or pre-historic times. The specific ages of the landslide activity are unknown, but likely range in the hundreds to thousands of years ago. The ares were digitized by analyzing digital elevation, hillshade and land cover data sources. The digital elevation and hillshade datasets are sourced from the metro's 2011 light detection and ranging (LIDAR) bare earth dataset. This dataset will be updated when newer LIDAR data becomes available. Undated Landslide Types Small slide: Areas of active erosion and multiple small slides; shallow-seated, estimated plane of failure is less than 4.5m (15ft); includes ravine sides that are subject to failure; common throughout the Lake Minnetonka region and interior of the county and along first order stream valleys and ravines.Scarp and flank: Steep head and side slopes where slide originated; deep-seated, estimated failure plane depth is greater than 4.5 m (15ft); may also include ravine heads, sapping basins, and human modified slopes; not always paired with a clear deposit.River slope: Intermediary between the large landslide and small slides and found along major rivers.Deposit: Lobe or fan-shaped area with smooth, hummocky or blocky surface expression; may include debris fans or colluvial fans; includes large historic landslides; primarily located along the major rivers and tributaries.Modified slope: Non-natural terrain in steep slope zone that may have been modified or repaired subsequent to a landslide: does not include areas of steep slopes that were clearly modified but had no indication of past landslides (e.g. highway slopes).

,MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Hosted Feature Layer which provides access to the MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification geospatial data product.MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data consists of linear geometric features which showcase the functional classification of roadways throughout the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission & coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.The State of Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs.  Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning & Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD).

The data supports MDOT State Highway Administration leadership and planners as they endeavor to mitigate or prevent the impacts of sea level change resulting from land surface subsidence and rising sea levels. The product uses sea-level projections to forecasts areas of inundation for a given scenario. University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) provides the sea level change (SLC) estimate. SLC is localized using qualifying National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference stations.The data may be used and redistributed for free but is not intended for legal use, since it likely contains inaccuracies.

,"2014 PADEP Integrated List for Chester County, PA","Metadata: Review and/or download a4-page metadata document(.pdf format) from the Chester County Water Resources Authority web site.Background on PADEP assessment program:The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) has an ongoing program to assess the quality of waters in Pennsylvania and identify streams and other bodies of water that do not meet water quality standards as ""impaired."" Water quality standards are comprised of the uses (including antidegradation) that waters can support and goals established to protect those uses. Uses include aquatic life, fish consumption, potable water supply, and recreation. The goals are numerical or narrative water quality criteria that express the in-stream levels that must be achieved to support the uses.Periodic reports on the quality of waters in the Commonwealth are required under section 305(b) of the federal Clean Water Act. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to list all imparied waters not supporting uses even after appropriate and required water pollution control technologies have been applied. Since 2004, PADEP has adopted an integrated format for Clean Water Act Section 305(b) reporting and Section 303(d) listing. The list of impaired streams, as well as the list of streams assessed that met the water quality standards, are found in the ""2014 Pennsylvania Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report"" on the PADEP web page.Description of GIS data and source files:CCWRA has combined the two source files provided by PADEP (see below) so that each stream segment has only one record. Fields for each use assessment has been added to correlate to records in the previous files.Source data sets are fromPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 2015 i.

The original data contained Urban Clusters, which were removed. The data was given a projected coordinate system, but no other changes have been made to the original source data. The source data was downloaded in May 2015 from the following website:http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ua/urban-rural-2010.htmlDescription from US Census Bureau:The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the ""urban footprint."" There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000).
