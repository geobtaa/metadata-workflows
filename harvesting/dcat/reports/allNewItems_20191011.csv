911a24f09f9c4dfc95ac53897256fc65_0,04a-01,MDOT SHA NPDES Structures,,"BackgroundAs a government agency that owns and maintains separate storm sewer systems, the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) is mandated to file a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). The permit requires the inventory, inspection, and maintenance of SHA stormwater infrastructure. SHA is responsible for maintaining storm drain infrastructure on more than 5,000 miles of roadway statewide. SHA has developed a program consisting of SHA personnel, data managers, and subject matter experts to support the permit requirements and maintain these roadways. The tasks involved in the SHA NPDES data collection program are often completed by engineering consultants for SHA. The data are organized into a series of drainage systems with stormwater management facilities that are interconnected, allowing for flow-tracing function through distinct systems. A drainage system is defined as a series of storm drain structures or point features (i.e., manholes, inlets, endwalls) that connect hydraulically through conveyance features such as pipes and / or ditches. Closed and open storm drain structures are connected by pipe and ditch conveyance to create the drainage system. Stormwater management facilities (SWMF), also known as stormwater best management practices (BMP) are inventoried with the storm drain system. A system can include both open and closed storm drain features. StructuresPhysical stormwater structures to be identified and inventoried include headwalls, endwalls, cross culverts, pumping stations, stormwater risers and weirs, inlets, pipe connections, and manholes. Storm drain structures are represented as point features in the database. Several database features are included that are not existing physical structures, but are employed to facilitate connection of drainage systems in the database. For detailed descriptions of each feature, refer to the?SHA Book of Standard for Highway  Incidental Structures, Category 3 ?Drainage.? Storm drain structures within SHA ROW are inventoried. Information on private storm drain structures will need to be collected if a private system ties into SHA-owned storm drain features. The only structures that are not inventoried within SHA ROW are single residential driveway culvert end structures (See below for more details), bridge inlets, under drains, roof drainage, or other private tie-ins with the exception of the first or last structure from a private storm drain system and curb opening. If an under-drain pipe has an end structure (such as an endwall), then the structure is inventoried. Curb openings are only inventoried when affecting the drainage area for a BMP or major outfalls. If it is deemed necessary to include a curb cut in the database, the curb cut is captured as an inlet feature with comments identifying the feature as a curb opening. A curb opening is not a COG or COS inlet with an open back, but simply a cut in the curb where sheet flow is exiting impervious. The following are brief discussions of the structures in the data. See Chapter 2 of the Maryland SHA Stormwater NPDES Program SOP for more information, figures, and descriptions of each field. End / Head StructuresAn end / head structure is any structure at the upstream or downstream end of a culvert or pipe. These can include headwalls, endwalls, end sections, and projection pipes. Often the end / head structure is designated on the contract sheets and field verified. When contract plans are not available for a roadway, the SHA Book of Standard for Highway  Incidental Structures should be referenced if structure types are unfamiliar with field teams. Outfall areas are not to be inventoried, but will be analyzed during the inspection process. Headwalls (HW) are structures that are placed at the upstream end of pipes and culverts to provide a stable or hydraulically desirable entrance to the conveyance. Headwalls are usually concrete but can be constructed of wood or masonry, such as brick or concrete block. Wall structures on the upstream side of a culvert or pipe are inventoried as headwalls. Plan sheets may designate the upstream end of a pipe or culvert as an endwall, but these structures should be inventoried as headwalls. All wall-end structures at the upstream end of a pipe or culvert should be inventoried as headwalls. Endwalls (EW) are structures that are placed at the downstream end of pipes and culverts to provide a stable or hydraulically desirable exit to the conveyance. Endwalls are usually concrete, but can be constructed of wood or masonry such as brick or concrete block. All wall structures on the downstream side of a culvert or pipe are inventoried as endwalls. Plan sheets may designate the downstream end of pipe or culvert as a headwall, but these structures should be inventoried as endwalls. All wall-end structures at the downstream end of a pipe or culvert should be inventoried as endwalls. End Sections (ES) are structures that transition the ends of pipes into slopes and provide stability to the pipe entrances and outflows. End sections do not affect the hydraulic capacity or efficiency of the pipes. End sections can be constructed of concrete, metal, or plastic (HDPE). End sections can either be inventoried at the upstream or downstream end of a pipe. Projection Pipes (PP) are not physical structures but represent the upstream and downstream end of a pipe if an end structure on a pipe does not exist. Projection pipes are captured spatially as a feature and represent the ends of pipes. Inlet StructuresInlets are structures that collect storm drain runoff. Inlets convey the runoff to closed storm drain systems, open conveyance, or outfalls. There are many different types of inlet structures, and all are discussed in the SHA Standard Design Manual and should be reviewed prior to conducting an inventory. Spring heads are also inventoried as inlets. Inlets (IN) are hydraulic structure chambers below surface grade that collect storm drain runoff. An inlet either has a grate or open sides / curb to allow runoff to enter the storm drain system. Inlets are often constructed of concrete, masonry brick, or concrete block. Spring Heads (SH) are inventoried as inlets. Spring heads are inventoried only where they emerge and are connected to a storm drain system. Spring heads are inventoried because they provide evidence for the presence of ground water for dry weather flows during illicit discharge field screening operation. Spring heads may be identified from contract drawings or identified during the field inventory. Spring heads are mostly found in rural areas. Connection StructuresA connection structure is a storm drain structure that connects conveyance (pipes and ditches) within a system and is not an inlet, riser, weir, or pumping station. These can include manholes, ditch intersections, junction boxes, pipe connections, wye connections, capped inlets, pipe bends, and pipe directions. Because field crews are not required to open manhole lids and enter closed storm drain structures, no designation type is necessary for connection structures. All of the attribute data for these structures will be collected from contract drawings, including connection material and top of manhole elevations. The existence of connection structures should be field verified for spatial accuracy, even though the attributed data will be collected from contract drawings. For structures that are buried or paved over, a GPS point is to be recorded at the best estimated location in the field based on contract plan sheets. The verification of attribute table data for structures that cannot be verified in the field will be completed based on plan sheet information. This also holds true for structures that are buried or cannot be accessed; the attribute data should be obtained from plan sheets. Manholes (MH) are hydraulic structures that connect pipes through a system. They are used as access points to a system, to change direction or invert elevations for pipes, as a junction to change pipe size and / or material, and as a junction of multiple pipes to a single pipe. Manholes are frequently paved over or buried, but are still inventoried. Unless it is certain that the manhole does not exist, the manhole is inventoried. Manholes with lids that have designed holes to allow runoff to enter are inventoried as manholes and not inlets. Ditch Intersections (ID) are geographic representations of where ditches meet, begin, or end a system and are captured as point features. These features are used to define the extents of ditches. Junction Boxes (JB) are underground hydraulic structures that connect pipes through a system. They are used to change direction or invert elevations for pipes, to change pipe size and / or material, and to connect multiple pipes to a single pipe. Identifying junction boxes in the field is difficult because these structures are usually buried with no part of the structure exposed to the surface. Junction boxes are only inventoried from contract drawings and should never be assumed in the field, unless the field crew is certain the structure is a junction box. If the field crew suspects that pipes are merging together and no contract plans are available to confirm this, the connection should be inventoried as a pipe connection and not a junction box. Pipe Connections (PC) are locations throughout the conveyance of a system where two or more pipes connect. A pipe connection is also captured at the location where a closed storm drain pipe connects to a culvert or stream crossing. Wye Connections (YC) are hydraulic structures that join two pipes together within a system?s conveyance. Wye connections will be identified from contract drawings and should not be assumed in the field. Instead of assuming a wye connection structure in the field, a pipe connection should be inventoried. Access to wye connections will not be possible in the field, so the material should be determined from the contract drawings. Capped Inlets (CI) are inlets that have been capped for some reason, such as roadway widening. These are not inventoried as inlets, but as connectors. Capped inlets should be identified from the contract drawings and should not be assumed in the field. Pipe Bends (PB) are locations along a conveyance where a pipe makes a significant turn in direction and are usually shown on contract plan sheets. Pipe bends can be actual physical features or used to facilitate an accurate representative of the pipe. Pipe bends will be identified from contract drawings and will be at the discretion of the team to determine if a pipe bend is necessary. Pipe bends can also be used if the pipe turns and no pipe bend feature is identified on the plans, such as pipes that make slight S-turns. Pipe Directions (PD) are not physical features in the field, but represent connectivity with private storm drain systems when an upstream or downstream private structure cannot be located in the field. If an SHA storm drain flows into or out of a private storm drain structure, then the first or last structure in the private system is inventoried. Pipe directions are used in the inventory when it is obvious that an SHA storm drain system is flowing into or from a private system, but the private downstream or upstream connection is outside of SHA right of- way (ROW) and / or cannot be found. In these situations, a PD is inventoried so that the pipe feature can be created and pipe attributes can be recorded. Pipe directions are not used within SHA ROW because SHA would like to know the exact access point for every system.  Control StructuresA control structure is any type of structure that controls flows. Control structures will most often be riser, weir, or emergency spillway structures. Although other structures such as inlets, headwalls, end sections, projection pipes, and pump stations can function as a control structures as well. Riser structures and weirs (and emergency spillways) are collected in separate tables because they require collection of additional attributes not associated with other types of control structures. Information about risers and weirs that is collected in the field and from contract sets includes material, riser type, trash rack existence, and orifice invert elevations. Monitoring wells and infiltration trench observation wells are not considered control structures and are not inventoried but identified in the inspection process.  Riser Structures (SW) are vertical structures extending from the bottom of a stormwater BMP that are used to control discharge rates from a BMP for specified design storms. Riser structures are normally constructed of concrete or corrugated metal. Riser structures may or may not have low-flow orifices and / or trash racks. Typically riser structures are designed with different type of inflow devises to control flow out of stormwater BMPs and are normally connected to an outfall pipe. During the BMP inspection process, BMP control structures will be examined for flaws and structural integrity. Weir Structures (SW) are earthen notches or other water barriers, such as a concrete or gabion wall structure, in a berm dam through which flow of water out of a stormwater BMP is regulated and controlled. Weirs are commonly constructed from concrete, wood, metal, earthen, or riprap. Weir structures may or may not have low-flow orifices and / or trash racks. Because earthen spillway embankment weirs may be difficult to find in the field, efforts should be made to identify weir structures prior to conducting a field inventory. Emergency Spillways (EM) are depressions or notches in cut that convey stormwater BMP overflow in a controlled manner, rather than allowing it to overtop the embankment. The material of an emergency spillway can be concrete, earthen, or riprap. Emergency spillways are inventoried if they exist for a stormwater BMP and are recorded in the WEIR table. Because earthen emergency spillways may be difficult to find in the field, they should be identified prior to conducting a field inventory. Pumping Stations (PS) are mechanical pumps stored in a pump house that pump or lift stormwater uphill to a high point where gravity can again convey flow. Pump stations are considered control structures because they control the quantity of water being pumped out of a BMP. Pump stations are rare and are mostly identified from contract drawings. Attribute information is collected from contract plans and include number of pumps, station name, maximum capacity, and installation date. The field team only needs to locate the pump house and are not to enter the pump station.SimplificationsThe simplification process flattens database tables that normalize attribute information, resulting in a dataset with all attributes but also many null fields when the attribute type is not relevant to the structure type.

d588b42cc24f4ef48235a86259da3270_0,04a-01,MDOT SHA NPDES SWMFAC,,"BackgroundAs a government agency that owns and maintains separate storm sewer systems, the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) is mandated to file a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). The permit requires the inventory, inspection, and maintenance of SHA stormwater infrastructure. SHA is responsible for maintaining storm drain infrastructure on more than 5,000 miles of roadway statewide. SHA has developed a program consisting of SHA personnel, data managers, and subject matter experts to support the permit requirements and maintain these roadways. The tasks involved in the SHA NPDES data collection program are often completed by engineering consultants for SHA.The data are organized into a series of drainage systems with stormwater management facilities that are interconnected, allowing for flow-tracing function through distinct systems. A drainage system is defined as a series of storm drain structures or point features (i.e., manholes, inlets, endwalls) that connect hydraulically through conveyance features such as pipes and / or ditches. Closed and open storm drain structures are connected by pipe and ditch conveyance to create the drainage system. Stormwater management facilities (SWMF), also known as stormwater best management practices (BMP) are inventoried with the storm drain system. A system can include both open and closed storm drain features.Stormwater Management FacilitiesStormwater management facilities (SWMFAC) are structural best management practices that temporarily store or treat stormwater runoff to reduce flooding, remove pollutants, and provide other amenities. Stormwater BMPs are impoundment areas that treat stormwater runoff to reduce flooding, remove pollutants, and provide other benefits such as wildlife attraction. Pollutant removal can be accomplished through retaining permanent pools of water, detaining water temporarily and then releasing it slowly, infiltrating runoff into the ground, filtering the water through a medium into the ground, or combining multiple treatments. Stormwater management facilities are represented as polygons in the database.If a stormwater BMP is receiving SHA runoff, the feature is inventoried, regardless of the owner. Attributes recorded for each stormwater BMP feature include type, location, status, and owner. Refer to the Maryland Stormwater Management Guidelines for State  Federal Projects - Volume I  II for stormwater BMP types and common features related to stormwater BMPs. Stormwater BMP design plan sheets will be supplied to the team and should be used as the source for the stormwater BMP inventory.?Stormwater BMPs that are inventoried include, but are not limited to, ponds, wetlands, infiltration practices, filtration practices, and ESD BMPs. Stormwater BMPs are inventoried and recorded in the SWMFAC feature class. Due to the large number of different types, sizes, and shapes of these facilities, the SWMFAC table entries are not as standardized as the storm drain structure elements.SimplificationsThe simplification process flattens database tables that normalize attribute information, resulting in a dataset with all attributes but also many null fields when the attribute type is not relevant to the SWMFAC type.

Roadway Administrative Classification is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.There are 29,265 centerline miles of roadway in the State of Maryland. Of this total, the?Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) maintains 5,243 centerline miles (17.92%). Although this represents less than 20 percent of the total miles of roadways in the State, these highways account for approximately 70% of the total vehicle miles of travel in the State. The 5,243 miles of highways maintained by the?Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) are categorized for funding purposes as Primary and Secondary highways. The State Primary Systems consists of approximately 1,288 miles of state maintained routes or 25 percent of the total State maintained road mileage. The State Primary System was originally adopted in 1972 and revised in 1978 in accordance with provisions of State law. The Primary System serves the state in the same manner as the Interstate System serves the nation. It has been a policy of the Department to develop the Primary System with a maximum practical degree of access control in order to provide safety to the motorist. The Secondary System is a network of State routes which serve inter-regional and localized traffic. This network consists of 3,955 miles (75.45%) of the total State maintained roadways and provides feeder and support functions to the Primary System. It also complements county highway systems.Roadway?Administrative Classification data is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD).

dd869061282f449386135676fa518f13_0,04a-01,MDOT SHA NPDES Conveyance,,"BackgroundAs a government agency that owns and maintains separate storm sewer systems, the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) is mandated to file a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). The permit requires the inventory, inspection, and maintenance of SHA stormwater infrastructure. SHA is responsible for maintaining storm drain infrastructure on more than 5,000 miles of roadway statewide. SHA has developed a program consisting of SHA personnel, data managers, and subject matter experts to support the permit requirements and maintain these roadways. The tasks involved in the SHA NPDES data collection program are often completed by engineering consultants for SHA.The data are organized into a series of drainage systems with stormwater management facilities that are interconnected, allowing for flow-tracing function through distinct systems. A drainage system is defined as a series of storm drain structures or point features (i.e., manholes, inlets, endwalls) that connect hydraulically through conveyance features such as pipes and / or ditches. Closed and open storm drain structures are connected by pipe and ditch conveyance to create the drainage system. Stormwater management facilities (SWMF), also known as stormwater best management practices (BMP) are inventoried with the storm drain system. A system can include both open and closed storm drain features.ConveyanceConveyance features to be identified and inventoried include actual, physical features (pipes and ditches) and database connectivity features (hydraulic connectors). Conveyance is represented as line features in the database. Although they do not physically exist, hydraulic connectors should be inventoried to facilitate connection of drainage systems through stormwater BMPs; this is the only case where a hydraulic connector is created. Not every pipe or ditch conveyance is inventoried, but generally all conveyances between structures are inventoried. Conveyance features will have an upstream and downstream structure. When contract plans are not available showing proper conveyance for a storm drain system, conveyance can be determined by looking at the pipe(s) direction inside of structures. Field crews are not required to open manhole lids, and conveyance can be assumed at the field crew?s discretion when plans are not available.Pipes, Cross Culverts,  Driveway CulvertsPipes connect structures together in a system to maintain conveyance. Pipes consist of closed storm drain pipes, cross culverts, and driveway culverts. Rules for collecting cross culvert and driveway culvert pipes are described below. The following are rules that should be followed when collecting pipes within the storm drain network:All pipes between closed storm drain structures are inventoried.Pipes less than five feet in height are inventoried within SHA ROW.Pipes that are greater than five feet in height are not inventoried if they do not connect to closed storm drain structures.?Pipes that are greater than five feet in height and do connect to closed storm drain structures are inventoried with the storm drain network.Closed storm drain systems that outfall through a pipe or culvert that is greater than five feet in height are inventoried.?Pipe size, shape, invert, and material are recorded for all pipes. Because field crews are not required to open grates or manhole lids, this attribute information is most often gathered from contract plans. Pipe sizes and material should be verified in the field by observation through inlet grates and at end structures (headwalls, end sections, outfalls, projection pipes). Field crews should become familiar with different pipe sizes and materials prior to conducting field inventory.Cross Culverts are pipes, boxes, or arches that convey water from one side of the ROW to the other side, usually under the roadway. Cross culverts are inventoried as pipes. Depending on the situation and culvert size, not all cross culverts will be inventoried. The following are rules that should be followed when collecting cross culverts:The culvert height is determined from contract plans when available. Otherwise care should be taken to measure and estimate the actual culvert height in the field. This may require estimating the depth of sedimentation at the culvert ends to determine the feet of buried culvert.Culverts that are less than five feet in height are inventoried.Culverts that are greater than five feet in height are not inventoried.A culvert that is greater than five feet in height that has a closed storm drain tying in is not inventoried. Instead, the most downstream structure in the closed storm drain system is inventoried as a pipe connection at the location the storm drain system connects to the culvert.Driveway Culverts and entrance culverts are pipes, possibly with an end structure, that conveys water under driveways, utility access roads, or stormwater BMP access roads. Not all driveway culverts will be inventoried within SHA ROW. The following are rules that should be followed when collection driveway culverts:Private driveway culverts and culverts at farm or other access points that do not require access permits should not be inventoried. Culverts under entrance drives that provide two-way or greater traffic such as multi-family residential, commercial, public, or industrial properties are inventoried. Culverts under SHA-owned stormwater maintenance access or other utility access roads should also be inventoried.If the private driveway or access drive culvert has a closed storm drain structure such as an inlet or riser on the upstream or downstream end of the pipe, then the culvert should be inventoried.If a driveway culvert is excluded from the inventory, other adjoining closed drain structures completing the system should be connected using a ditch. The ditch in this case should be drawn through the culverts as if the culvert does not exist.DitchesDitches and open conveyance are channels or flow paths that connect open structures (headwalls, end sections, endwalls, projection pipes, inlets with open backs) in a system to maintain the conveyance. Attributes collected for ditches include material (vegetative, concrete, riprap, etc.), bottom width, and side slope. Not all ditches or open channels within SHA ROW are to be inventoried in the geodatabase. Ditches to be inventoried are the following:Ditches or open conveyance between open structures.Ditches or open conveyance greater than two feet in bottom width.Ditches or open conveyance that flow into stormwater BMPs regardless of bottom width.Hydraulic ConnectorsHydraulic Connectors connect the outfalls into stormwater BMPs to the control structure of the stormwater BMP to maintain conveyance through the system. Hydraulic connectors are used to represent connectivity through a stormwater BMP from inflows to control structures. Inflow points and control structures for stormwater BMPs should be connected with a hydraulic connector, including infiltration trenches. If hydraulic connectors do not exist in the previous inventory, the current development should create them. The hydraulic connector line features are stored in the CONVEYANCE feature class and no additional attribute information is collected. The connector is use so that connectivity between structures is maintained through stormwater BMPs and network tracing can occur.SimplificationsThe simplification process flattens database tables that normalize attribute information, resulting in a dataset with all attributes but also many null fields when the attribute type is not relevant to the SWMFAC type. The simplified data are a snapshot in time of the production NPDES data, updated every night.PublishingThis service was last published by Elliott Plack on 9/6/2019 based on a materialized view created by John Shiu.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2019-09-06T22:47:22.000Z,,,Maryland,"-79.4108,37.9581,-75.0173,39.7197",Maryland,State of Maryland,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/dd869061282f449386135676fa518f13_0,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/dd869061282f449386135676fa518f13_0.zip,https://maps.roads.maryland.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NPDES/NPDES_Simple_Conveyance_Maryland_MDOTSHA/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,NPDES|stormwater|connectivity|pipes|ditches|MDOT|SHA|MDOT SHA|Maryland

The data represents individuals arrested with a marijuana charge, regardless of whether there was a more serious secondary charge. If an arrestee was charged with multiple marijuana charges, the arrest is only counted once under the more serious charge type: Distribution, Possession with Intent to Distribute, Possession, Public Consumption.?Due to privacy considerations, exact CCNs and arrest numbers for these arrest datasets are not provided. In lieu, hash numbers are provided for CNN which allows individuals to determine whether there are multiple arrests associated with one event. Additionally, arrest numbers can be linked directly to an individual and therefore DC government does not provide this more generally, but again as hash numbers.MPD collects race and ethnicity data according to the United States Census Bureau standards (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html). Hispanic, which was previously categorized under the Race field prior to August 2015, is now captured under Ethnicity. All records prior to August 2015 have been updated to ?Unknown (Race), Hispanic (Ethnicity)?. Race and ethnicity data are based on officer observation, which may or may not be accurate.MPD cannot release exact addresses to the general public unless proof of ownership or subpoena is submitted. The GeoX and GeoY values represent the block location (approximately 232 ft. radius) as of the date of the arrest. Due to the Department?s redistricting efforts in 2012 and 2017, data may not be comparable in some years.Arrestee age is calculated based on the number of days between the self-reported or verified date of birth (DOB) of the arrestee and the date of the arrest; DOB data may not be accurate if self-reported or if the arrestee refused to provide it.Due to the sensitive nature of juvenile data and to protect the arrestee?s confidentiality, any arrest records for defendants under the age of 18 have been coded as ?Juvenile? for the following fields:? Arrest Time? CCN? Age? Offense Location Block GeoX/Y? Defendant Race? Defendant Ethnicity? Defendant Sex? Arrest Location Block Address? Arrest Location Block GeoX/YThis data may not match other marijuana data requests that may have included all law enforcement agencies in the District, or only the most serious charge.

The Metropolitan Police Department collects race and ethnicity data according to the United States Census Bureau standards (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html). Hispanic, which was previously categorized under the Race field prior to August 2015, is now captured under Ethnicity. All records prior to August 2015 have been updated to ?Unknown (Race), Hispanic (Ethnicity)?. Race, ethnicity and gender data are based on officer observation, which may or may not be accurate.Due to privacy considerations, exact CCNs and arrest numbers for these arrest datasets are not provided. In lieu, hash numbers are provided for CNN which allows individuals to determine whether there are multiple arrests associated with one event. Additionally, arrest numbers can be linked directly to an individual and therefore DC government does not provide this more generally, but again as hash numbers.MPD cannot release exact addresses to the general public unless proof of ownership or subpoena is submitted. The GeoX and GeoY values represent the block location (approximately 232 ft. radius) as of the date of the arrest and offense. Arrest and offense addresses that could not be geocoded are included as an ?unknown? value.Arrestee age is calculated based on the number of days between the self-reported or verified date of birth (DOB) of the arrestee and the date of the arrest; DOB data may not be accurate if self-reported, and an arrestee may refuse to provide his or her date of birth. Due to the sensitive nature of juvenile data and to protect the arrestee?s confidentiality, any arrest records for defendants under the age of 18 or with missing age are excluded in this dataset.The Criminal Complaint Number (CCN) and arrest number have also been anonymized.This data may not match other arrest data requests that may have included all law enforcement agencies in the District or all arrest charges. Arrest totals are subject to change and may be different than MPD Annual Report totals or other publications due to inclusion of juvenile arrest summary, expungements, investigation updates, data quality audits, etc. ",Flagged,,ArcGIS Hub Dataset|Esri Rest API|GeoJSON|CSV,,,2019-09-09T18:20:34.000Z,,,"Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia|Maryland|Virginia","-77.6754,38.2954,-76.6977,39.2386",Maryland,"Washington, District of Columbia",D.C.

A negative 1 meter buffer was applied to all building features with an area greater than 200 square meters - applied in an effort to ensure nDSM input values were those corresponding to the building roof and not the adjacent ground.
Zonal statistics (Spatial Analyst extension) were calculated on the buffered features for each nDSM raster (first multiplying each raster by 10 to maintain precision and then converting from floating point to integer raster) and slope raster (generated from each integerized nDSM raster). Zonal percentile statistics were also calculated on buffered features for each raster to obtain the 90th percentile building heights (HEIGHT_ESTIMATE field).
All output statistics fields were joined to the original input feature class (with unit conversions applied, where necessary).
A complete dataset, which includes the following fields that are populated with various statistical outputs generated during the building height estimation process, is available upon request:
HEIGHT_PCT90 ? 90th percentile value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
HEIGHT_PCT50 ? median value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
HEIGHT_COUNT ? total number of cells with tabulated values in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_MEAN ? average of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_STD ? standard deviation of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_COUNT - total number of cells with tabulated values in the slope raster located within the building footprint.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2017-04-05T21:02:32.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-75.7041,39.9854,-75.0029,40.4346",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b8451c9157bc4eb28fdaf4c8cb84e396_0,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b8451c9157bc4eb28fdaf4c8cb84e396_0.zip,https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Structures/MontgomeryCo_Impervious/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,DVRPC|Pennsylvania|Impervious Surface|Structures|Building Footprints|Building Heights|Buildings|Roads|Driveways|Parking Lots|Sidewalks|Montgomery County|Planning

19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0,04f-01,DVRPC Connections 2045 Planning Center Neighborhoods,,"Connections 2045 Plan for Greater Philadelphia - Administrative Version DVRPC Publication No. 17039 12/2017The concept of Centers is the cornerstone of the Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan. Centers provide a focal point in the regional landscape that recognizes the regional and local significance of places, while reinforcing a sense of community for local residents. Centers serve as a basis for organizing and focusing the development landscape and provide a framework for the most efficient provision of supportive infrastructure systems, including water, sewer, and transportation. By concentrating growth around and within Centers, the region can both preserve open space and reduce infrastructure costs. The densities and mixed uses inherent within Centers can enhance the feasibility of walking, bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile. Connections 2040identifies a hierarchy of seven Center types, shown on the Planning Areas and Centers map, based on their role and activities within the region.METROPOLITAN CENTERCenter City/University City/Camden Central Business District ? spanning the Delaware River and bounded roughly by 40th Street from Girard to Washington avenues in Philadelphia and by the Ben Franklin Bridge and Interstate 676 to Clinton Street in Camden ? is identified as the region?s Metropolitan Center. This dense, compact, mixed-use area includes the central business districts of Philadelphia and Camden, major academic and medical institutions, and major tourist and entertainment destinations.METROPOLITAN SUBCENTERSThe Plan also identifies six Metropolitan Subcenters, reflecting their magnitude of jobs and commercial activity. These include the downtown area of Trenton and the destinations of King of Prussia/Valley Forge (Montgomery and Chester counties); International Airport (Delaware and Philadelphia counties), Navy Yard/Sports Complex (Philadelphia); Cherry Hill/Mount Laurel/Marlton (Burlington and Camden counties); and the Route 1 Corridor (Mercer County).NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERSConnections 2040recognizes that each of the region?s Core Cities is a collection of diverse neighborhoods with varying characteristics, assets, challenges, and needs, and that specific approaches and strategies for improving and revitalizing these neighborhoods will differ. The planning policies within the Core Cities and their neighborhoods focus on redevelopment and revitalization through targeted investment and reinvestment. Embedded within the region?s Core Cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester are Neighborhood Centers, which are recognizable places with a mix of commercial, retail, anchor institutional, and residential activities. Neighborhood Centers have an identifiable main street or focal point, are walkable, and have a unique history or sense of a community within the larger city setting. In addition to the metropolitan center, metropolitan subcenters, and neighborhood centers, the Plan identifies four other types of Centers: Suburban Centers, Town Centers, Rural Centers, and Planned Centers. The characteristics of each type are as follows:SUBURBAN CENTERSAre regionally significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are perceived as single ?places;? Are suburban in character; Are less dense than town centers; Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers; Are defined primarily by a concentration and variety of office, retail, professional, and light industrial uses, and generally have more jobs than residents; and are generally auto dependent rather than transit oriented or pedestrian scale.TOWN CENTERSHave a mixture of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than their surrounding land uses; Have a distinct downtown/main street area surrounded by relatively dense residential development; Are pedestrian friendly and often transit oriented; and Are surrounded by suburban land uses.RURAL CENTERSHave a minimum density of six people and three employees per developed acre; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area; Have a distinct downtown/main street (though smaller than a town center); and Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses. PLANNED CENTERSAre planned town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas or through redevelopment on greyfields and/or brownfields in Developed Communities; and Have plans that call for village-type development, incorporating mixed, integrated land uses, relatively high densities, and pedestrian connections.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2018-07-16T14:58:55.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-75.9774,39.6853,-74.5237,40.4401",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0.zip,https://services1.arcgis.com/LWtWv6q6BJyKidj8/arcgis/rest/services/DVRPC_Connections_2045_Planning_Center_Neighborhoods/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,DVRPC|Connections 2045|Long-Range Plan|Planned Centers|Core Cities|Neighborhood Centers|Planning|2045

 includes a Vision Plan of desired transportation investments. Federal 
requirements mandate that the Long-Range Plan be fiscally constrained 
and only include projects that can be funded with reasonably anticipated
 revenue sources. Due to the gap between future needs and anticipated 
funding, not all identified projects in the Vision Plan are able to be 
included in the fiscally constrained financial plan. The financial plan 
allocates revenue to different categories, and there are separate 
budgets for the Pennsylvania and New Jersey portions of the DVRPC 
region. These categories serve as placeholders for funding projects over
 the life of the Plan. The table below shows how revenue is allocated to
 different funding categories for both roadway and transit projects.Major Regional Projects are large-scale projects that will have a 
significant impact on regional travel. Almost all system expansion 
projects are Major Regional Projects, as are many reconstruction 
projects on the region?s freeways, and major operational improvement 
initiatives, such as SEPTA?s fare modernization project. Many more 
smaller-scale projects were identified in the needs assessment and 
funding for them was allocated in the Plan, but for the sake of brevity,
 they are not specifically identified or listed in the Plan. Major 
Regional Project needs that cannot be afforded are not included in the 
fiscally-constrained plan, and are shown as unfunded.

Delaware Valley Data is our periodic series of free data bulletins, data snapshots, and analytical data reports. This analytical data report provides revised 2040 and interim-year population and employment forecasts for the DVRPC region?s counties and municipalities. DVRPC prepared these forecasts in order to incorporate the results of the 2010 Census, account for the ongoing economic recession, and maintain a 30-year planning horizon. 2040 population forecasts were originally adopted by the DVRPC Board on January 26, 2012 and published in April 2012 in Analytical Data Report 18. On February 28, 2013, the DVRPC Board amended the 2040 and interim year population forecasts for Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to account for a significant residential development that was unforeseen when the 2040 population forecasts were adopted in January 2012. This amendment resulted in corresponding revisions to the population forecasts for Montgomery County and the DVRPC region as a whole. This amended analytical data report includes these revisions. This report also consolidates the adopted population forecasts for Princeton Township and Princeton Borough in Mercer County, New Jersey, which merged and became one municipality known simply as Princeton on January 1, 2013. Additionally, inconsistencies in some summary totals in ADR 18 caused by rounding were also corrected. The adopted population forecasts provided in this report will serve as the basis for DVRPC?s planning and modeling activities, along with the 2040 employment forecasts that were prepared and adopted in September 2012.NETS database for 2010 was used for employment data.http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/pubs/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR019http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/pubs/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR018-ASource of geographic boundaries: DVRPC",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2016-02-17T14:05:27.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-76.1513,39.5094,-74.3815,40.6087",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.zip,https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/PopEmpForecastMCD/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Demographics|Population|Employment|Municipality|Forecast

The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2016-06-02T14:13:56.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-76.1514,39.5093,-74.3813,40.6087",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0.zip,https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/DemoProfile2014Tracts/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Demographics|DVRPC|Census|American Community Survey

This dataset contains the updated urban area boundaries for the 2010 Census update cycle (recently updated in the Winter of 2017)NJDOT has revised the New Jersey urban area based upon the 2010 U.S. Census urban area boundaries. The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with a population = 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters are 2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are = 50,000. FHWA, however, defines urban areas slightly different. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is = 5,000, with Small Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas = 50,000. NJDOT followed the FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular, NJDOT extended outward the urban area (smoothed) to the nearest road, stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010 Census urban areas.The urban area update went through a thorough public review and comment period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan planning and organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases of the project to review the updated urban area.

d7345890bf0849e897a578899c7d11a1,04f-01,DVRPC RideScore Web App,,"RideScore is an on-line database that assesses the physical and 
demographic characteristics around transit stations that relate to how 
supportive of bicycling the area is, or could be.
					The database focuses on commuter rail stations outside of Center 
City Philadelphia as well as trolley and subway terminals where having 
direct, safe, and nonmotorized access between transit stations and a 
person's origin and/or destination is a challenge. 
					To assess this relationship, DVRPC staff collected data on 
various station area characteristics that are likely to be factors in 
the transit-bicycle connection. The sum of those factors is calculated 
to give each station a total RideScore. 
					Together, these individual factors, and a station's total 
RideScore, will give transit agencies, trail advocacy groups and 
municipalities a picture of the station area characteristics that 
contribute to demand for bicycle facilities and amenities. 
					Ultimately, RideScore may help communities identify and prioritize 
improvements designed to strengthen bicycle and transit connectivity.RideScore seeks to draw out meaningful connections between regional 
transit and bicycle use throughout the entire DVRPC region where first- and last-mile issues (having direct, safe, and nonmotorized access 
between transit stations and a person?s origin and/or destination) are 
most important: commuter rail stations, trolley and subway termini 
outside of Center City Philadelphia. Transit and bicycle networks have a
 mutually beneficial relationship in that each can be used to access the
 other in a way that does not compromise environmental, fiscal, and 
safety conditions as travel by auto would. 
							Each mode also expands the field of access of the other. A better coordinated transit and trail network would provide
 the stakeholders of these assets with a potential higher return on 
investment by increasing visibility, attracting new users, and sharing 
expenditures through yet untapped partnerships and funding sources. For 
users, a coordinated approach would mean greater access to places not 
traditionally accessed before by transit or bicycle.

The horizontal datum for this dataset is North American Datum, 1983, Geoid GRS 1980, and the data is projected in Lambert Conformal Conic StatePlane Pennsylvania South (FIPS 3702). Units are US Foot. The minimum size for building features is 200 square feet.
Process Steps for Calculating Building Height Statistics:
Normalized digital surface models (nDSM) and slope rasters were generated from 0.5-meter LiDAR data.
Geodesic area was calculated (in square feet) for all features classified as ?Building?.
A negative 1 meter buffer was applied to all building features with an area greater than 200 square meters - applied in an effort to ensure nDSM input values were those corresponding to the building roof and not the adjacent ground.
Zonal statistics (Spatial Analyst extension) were calculated on the buffered features for each nDSM raster (first multiplying each raster by 10 to maintain precision and then converting from floating point to integer raster) and slope raster (generated from each integerized nDSM raster). Zonal percentile statistics were also calculated on buffered features for each raster to obtain the 90th percentile building heights (HEIGHT_ESTIMATE field).
All output statistics fields were joined to the original input feature class (with unit conversions applied, where necessary).
A complete dataset, which includes the following fields that are populated with various statistical outputs generated during the building height estimation process, is available upon request:
HEIGHT_PCT90 ? 90th percentile value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
HEIGHT_PCT50 ? median value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
HEIGHT_COUNT ? total number of cells with tabulated values in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_MEAN ? average of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_STD ? standard deviation of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_COUNT - total number of cells with tabulated values in the slope raster located within the building footprint.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2017-04-05T20:57:25.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-75.6003,39.8089,-75.2083,40.0628",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0.zip,https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Structures/DelawareCo_Impervious/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,DVRPC|Impervious Surface|Structures|Building Footprints|Building Heights|Buildings|Roads|Driveways|Parking Lots|Sidewalks|Delaware County|Pennsylvania|Planning

16fd37720d8a4adf85d255940f868138_1,04f-01,DVRPC - New Jersey Urban Areas,,"New Jersey Urban Boundaries - The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), Bureau of Transportation Data and Safety (BTDS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is required to update the urban area and functional classification of roadways following the decennial Census as part of the Federal-Aid highway funding program.  This dataset contains the updated urban area boundaries for the 2010 Census update cycle (recently updated in the Winter of 2017)NJDOT has revised the New Jersey urban area based upon the 2010 U.S. Census urban area boundaries. The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with a population = 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters are 2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are = 50,000. FHWA, however, defines urban areas slightly different. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is = 5,000, with Small Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas = 50,000. NJDOT followed the FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular, NJDOT extended outward the urban area (smoothed) to the nearest road, stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010 Census urban areas.The urban area update went through a thorough public review and comment period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan planning and organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases of the project to review the updated urban area. All comments were logged into an Urban Area Comment Tracking Form, and an official NJDOT response was provided for each comment.Pennsylvania Urban Boundaries?- Urban area boundaries within Pennsylvania based on U.S Census Bureau maps.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2018-10-18T20:00:57.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-75.5412,38.9273,-73.8983,41.2479",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/16fd37720d8a4adf85d255940f868138_1,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/16fd37720d8a4adf85d255940f868138_1.zip,https://services1.arcgis.com/LWtWv6q6BJyKidj8/arcgis/rest/services/DVRPC_Urban_Areas/FeatureServer/1,,FeatureServer,DVRPC|Urban Areas

def7081206b042cd848abe95a4a61a82_0,04f-01,DVRPC Connections 2045 Planning Areas,,"Connections 2045 Plan for Greater Philadelphia - Administrative Version DVRPC Publication No. 17039 12/2017Greater Philadelphia is a complex mosaic of 352 diverse cities, boroughs, and townships. The Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan characterizes each of the region?s municipalities as either a Core City, Developed Community, Growing Suburb, or Rural Area, as a means of categorizing the types of communities and defining the corresponding long-range planning policies most appropriate for each type. This categorization is shown on the Planning Areas and Centers dataset. Many municipalities have areas within their boundaries that fit the characteristics of more than one of these Planning Area types. Gloucester Township (in Camden County, New Jersey), for example, has neighborhoods that are fully developed, but it also has a significant number of undeveloped acres and forecasted population and employment growth more characteristic of a Growing Suburb. The intent of the Plan is to assign to each municipality the planning area type associated with the long-range planning policies that will be most beneficial to the entire community. While the Planning Areas and Centers map is a guide for policy direction at the regional scale, actual approaches should always be guided by local conditions.The region?s four Core Cities are Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester. Targeted infrastructure investment, maintenance and rehabilitation, comprehensive neighborhood revitalization, and efforts focused on reinforcing a network of social and educational programs will help to rebuild and revitalize the region?s cities.Developed Communities are places that have already experienced most of their population and employment growth, and include inner ring communities adjacent to the Core Cities; railroad boroughs and trolley car communities; and mature suburban townships. Many of these communities are stable and thriving, offering affordable housing opportunities; access to transit; safe pedestrian and bicycling environments; and a strong community identity. Others, however, are experiencing population and employment losses; have deteriorating infrastructure systems; have aging resident populations living on limited incomes; and have stagnant or declining tax bases that cannot keep pace with rising service demands. Rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure systems and the housing stock, and local economic and community development can help to reinforce location advantages, while stabilizing neighborhoods and stemming decline.Growing Suburbs are communities that have a significant number of developable acres remaining and are experiencing or are forecast to experience significant population and/or employment growth. Key planning policies in these communities focus on the need to improve the form of development, reduce congestion, and mitigate the negative consequences of unmanaged growth, and include growth management and enhanced community design. Smart growth techniques that support a more concentrated development pattern (such as clustering, mixed uses, transit-oriented development, and transfer of development rights) can provide the critical mass necessary to support new transit services and other alternatives to the automobile. The quality of design and architectural character of the built environment, open space preservation, and the creation of an integrated system of open space and recreation are all priorities in these communities.Rural Areas include the region?s agricultural communities and communities with large remaining natural areas. Key policy approaches for these communities focus on preservation and limiting development, and include limited expansion of infrastructure systems, preservation of a rural lifestyle and village character, support for continued farming, and enhanced natural resource protection. Livable communities in these areas include rural centers that have an identi fi able main street, a mix of uses, higher densities than their surrounding uses, and a true sense of place.

Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs. DVRPC currently assesses the following population groups, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau:YouthOlder AdultsFemaleRacial MinorityEthnic MinorityForeign BornDisabledLimited English ProficiencyLow-IncomeCensus tables used to gather data from the 2013 -2017 American Community Survey 5-Year EstimatesUsing U.S. Census American Community Survey data, the population groups listed above are identified and located at the census tract level. Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.Census tables used to gather data from the 2013 - 2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.For more information and for methodology, visit DVRPC's website:http://www.dvrpc.org/GetInvolved/TitleVI/Source of tract boundaries: US Census Bureau.

This is an update of existing features originally captured in 2013 using 2010 orthoimagery. ?Additionally, estimated building heights were derived from high resolution normalized digital surface elevation data models generated from NIR LiDAR data using the highest hit method. Digital surface elevation models were derived from LiDAR data collected by Quantum Spatial and other vendors and compiled for delivery to USGS and its partners. The horizontal datum for this dataset is North American Datum, 1983, Geoid GRS 1980, and the data is projected in Lambert Conformal Conic StatePlane Pennsylvania South (FIPS 3702). Units are US Foot. The minimum size for building features is 200 square feet.
Process Steps for Calculating Building Height Statistics:
Normalized digital surface models (nDSM) and slope rasters were generated from 0.5-meter LiDAR data.
Geodesic area was calculated (in square feet) for all features classified as ?Building?.
A negative 1 meter buffer was applied to all building features with an area greater than 200 square meters - applied in an effort to ensure nDSM input values were those corresponding to the building roof and not the adjacent ground.
Zonal statistics (Spatial Analyst extension) were calculated on the buffered features for each nDSM raster (first multiplying each raster by 10 to maintain precision and then converting from floating point to integer raster) and slope raster (generated from each integerized nDSM raster). Zonal percentile statistics were also calculated on buffered features for each raster to obtain the 90th percentile building heights (HEIGHT_ESTIMATE field).
All output statistics fields were joined to the original input feature class (with unit conversions applied, where necessary).
A complete dataset, which includes the following fields that are populated with various statistical outputs generated during the building height estimation process, is available upon request:
HEIGHT_PCT90 ? 90th percentile value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
HEIGHT_PCT50 ? median value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
HEIGHT_COUNT ? total number of cells with tabulated values in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_MEAN ? average of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.
SLOPE_STD ? standard deviation of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.

The P2 layer will support DVRPC?s more detailed planning analyses goals and other programs and projects at DVRPC and their member governments and agencies.Despite some overlap in the land use classification and data capture criteria for each effort, the P1 and P2 geodatabases do not completely correlate to one another due to the more detailed P2 classification, changes in the categorization of some land use features from P1 to P2 and revisions to the original DVRPC data capture criteria.All work was performed by AIS staff, at the AIS office in Redlands, California using Esri ArcGIS 10.3 software capabilities.

16fd37720d8a4adf85d255940f868138_0,04f-01,DVRPC - Pennsylvania Urban Areas,,"New Jersey Urban Boundaries - The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), Bureau of Transportation Data and Safety (BTDS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is required to update the urban area and functional classification of roadways following the decennial Census as part of the Federal-Aid highway funding program.  This dataset contains the updated urban area boundaries for the 2010 Census update cycle (recently updated in the Winter of 2017)NJDOT has revised the New Jersey urban area based upon the 2010 U.S. Census urban area boundaries. The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with a population = 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters are 2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are = 50,000. FHWA, however, defines urban areas slightly different. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is = 5,000, with Small Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas = 50,000. NJDOT followed the FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular, NJDOT extended outward the urban area (smoothed) to the nearest road, stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010 Census urban areas.The urban area update went through a thorough public review and comment period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan planning and organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases of the project to review the updated urban area. All comments were logged into an Urban Area Comment Tracking Form, and an official NJDOT response was provided for each comment.Pennsylvania Urban Boundaries?- Urban area boundaries within Pennsylvania based on U.S Census Bureau maps.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2018-10-18T20:00:57.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-80.4546,39.5966,-74.6847,42.3558",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/16fd37720d8a4adf85d255940f868138_0,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/16fd37720d8a4adf85d255940f868138_0.zip,https://services1.arcgis.com/LWtWv6q6BJyKidj8/arcgis/rest/services/DVRPC_Urban_Areas/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,DVRPC|Urban Areas

It is about how 10 percent of its populace would volunteer   to fight for the rights and freedom of others, but it is also about the 90   percent who supported this effort from the home front; the shared sacrifices   collectively borne by the families of those who enlisted. It is about how   citizens collectively supported one another and their soldiers. These are but   a few examples of the rich heritage of Oakland County and her people that   awaits you.
