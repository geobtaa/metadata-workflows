The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2019-12-17T17:17:47.000Z,,,Iowa,"-96.6077,40.3874,-90.1726,43.5007",Iowa,State of Iowa,Iowa Department of Transportation,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c42515b7c6734520bc34996506f08adf_0,"http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c42515b7c6734520bc34996506f08adf_0.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":3857,""wkid"":102100}",https://services.arcgis.com/8lRhdTsQyJpO52F1/arcgis/rest/services/SICL_Top_200_View/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Crash|Asset|Improvement|SICL|Intersection|Safety|Iowa DOT|Iowa Department of Transportation|Crash Analysis

2080de5bf60c40d1a748b872cff3db1d_0,04a-01,Maryland Freight Network,,"Baltimore City?s Freight Network consists of linear features which represent the street centerlines of the official truck routes in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. The purpose of this data is to identify through, local, and restricted truck routes within Baltimore City. These routes specify where large trucks are allowed to drive, for the use by truck operators, trucking companies, and City transportation offices. The linear geometric features of this dataset were created by merging the National Highway Freight Network (NHFN) (https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/infrastructure/nfn/index.htm) with Baltimore City's Freight Network (data provided by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation). A ?NHFN_ID? field is provided to distinguish City freight routes that are also a part of the NHFN. Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) values from 2017 are provided for each line segment where applicable. AADT values and percent utilization are provided for each vehicle classification (Motorcycle, Car, Light Truck, Single Unit Truck and Combination Unit Truck). A ?Freight AADT? field and a ?Freight Percent Utilization? field are also provided. Freight AADT was calculated by summing Single Unit Truck (FHWA Class 5 to 7) and Combination Unit Truck (FHWA Class 8 to 13) AADT values. Freight Percent Utilization was calculated by dividing the Freight AADT by the total AADT. Light Trucks (FHWA Class 3) were intentionally excluded from the Freight AADT and Freight Percent Utilization as these vehicles are not restricted to traversing on the City?s freight network. AADT data was obtained from the ?Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Lines? layer on MD iMAP (https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Transportation/MD_AnnualAverageDailyTraffic/FeatureServer/1).

The U.S. EPA's storm water program addressed storm water runoff in two phases. Phase I addressed storm water runoff from large and medium MS4s. Large municipalities with a separate storm sewer system serving a population greater than 250,000 and medium municipalities with a service population between 100,000 and 250,000 had to obtain NPDES permits. Initial application deadlines for large and medium municipalities were November 16, 1992 and May 17, 1993, respectively. As part of their individual NPDES permit applications, the large and medium MS4s had to develop a storm water management program (SWMP).

The Phase II regulations address storm water runoff of MS4s serving populations less than 100,000, called small MS4s. More particularly, small MS4s located partially or fully within urbanized areas (UAs), as determined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and also on a case-by-case basis for those small MS4s located outside of UAs that Ohio EPA designates into the program.

This program was established in 1967 to measure seasonal and annual water quality changes in the state's major aquifers. The network initially consisted of 12 large production wells, and was expanded to 60 wells in 1972. In 1986, the network was further expanded to around 90 wells. A large number of public water supply wells were added to the network in the late 1980s and early 1990s to provide better representation of the major aquifers in Ohio.?The program currently includes over 200 wells (stations). Of the total stations, roughly 85 percent are public water systems and 15 percent are industrial or commercial enterprises or residential. Raw water is analyzed for a suite of inorganic parameters every six, 18, or 36 months depending on the total number of samples that have been collected and the stability of the geochemistry of major elements at the site. Samples are also analyzed for volatile organic compounds once every 18 or 36 months.
