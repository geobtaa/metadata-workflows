7d88159091854e55a3e6f237fcd45c1a_0,04a-01,Maryland Road Centerlines - Comprehensive,,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at?https://imap.maryland.gov.Maryland Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for all public roadways in the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerlines data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway related data products.Maryland Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).?Maryland Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same look and feel across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications.

274f7c2b5f7c4ae19f165d9951057a00,04c-01,Buildings 3D - Detailed Roof,,"This dataset contains
3D rooftops for the District of Columbia in ESRI multipatch format. It includes
structures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates
based on 2010 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of
Columbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction
process that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures
from them to form roof polygons.Attributes containing roof height, slope and
orientation are included. This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset
produced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to
building rooftops identified in the course of the District of Columbia?s
separate planimetric update effort, which noted structures known that were
added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was
intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were
identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building
rooftop changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not
have been captured.?

This dataset contains
rooftops, including protrusions such as gabled windows, chimneys, elevator
utility rooms, etc.. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke
out those roof elements into separate files, as well as deliveries which included
complete 3D buildings with rooftops and facades. In many instances, row-houses
and other contiguous building rooftops could not be broken apart using the
process methodology and appear as a single structure. In some cases, entire
blocks of row houses are represented as a single feature, though visually they
can be distinguished easily. Additionally, the process captured small features,
such as canopy umbrellas and other structures as building rooftops and these
features may exist at various locations in the dataset.Many data gaps in the
earlier dataset (largely due to missing or reduced-resolution source imagery)
are corrected in this product. Based on comparison to DC?s available
planimetric datasets, there are still instances where particular structures are
omitted or not updated in the current product, but we believe that upwards of
99% of the District?s buildings are reflected in this dataset.All DC GIS data
is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.

It includes structures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates based on 2010 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of Columbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction process that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures from them by relating the roof polygons to an underlying Digital Elevation Model (2005 DEM developed by Earthdata)This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset produced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to buildings identified in the course of the District of Columbia?s separate planimetric update, which noted structures known that were added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010.

This document describes the processes used to create the orthoimagery data produced for the District of Columbia from 2015 digital aerial photography.??It was flown in mid to Late?April, completed on?April 24, 2015.?? Due to the low altitude flown to capture the complete imagery for the 2015 sensory flight, there is incomplete aerial photography coverage around the White House and the U.S. Capitol. For these areas, 2013 imagery was merged seamlessly using the street centerlines to define the 2013 merged areas. This minimized distortion of features.The project area covers the entire District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square miles. The digital imagery was used to create natural color digital orthophotography with 8cm pixel resolution. The final orthophotography deliverable products for this project consist of 328 ortho tiles at a scale of 1 to 2400. The tile dimensions are 800 meters by 800 meters. A corresponding MrSid image was created by mosaicing the 328 ortho tiles together and compressing the image using an 80 to 1 compression ration. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters. There are no coverage areas that are larger than the usual P56 (no fly zones). Areas outside of P56 that are redacted have been merged with 2013 - resampled to 3 inch (from 6 inch). Past flights were flown at 6,000 feet.

Benchmarking is defined as tracking a building?s energy?and water use and using a standard metric to compare the building?s performance against past?performance and to its peers nationwide. These comparisons have been shown to drive energy?efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. The District of?Columbia has chosen U.S. EPA?s free, industry-standard ENERGY STAR? Portfolio Manager? tool?for benchmarking and reporting. DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR??Benchmarking results for each privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking?law, beginning with the 2nd year of benchmarking data for that building. For more?information, see ddoe.dc.gov/energybenchmarking.PurposeThis data is used by the District, building owners and managers, and by prospective tenants?and buyers to evaluate and compare the energy efficiency of large privately owned buildings.?[For 2011 File:] 2011 energy bench marking data is being disclosed for privately owned?buildings over 200,000 gross square feet that also reported 2010 data.

The District of Columbia government requires a comprehensive range of GIS data and photogrammetric mapping to support a wide variety of applications through the DC GIS program. Due to technology advances, expanding user base needs, and aging data, DC GIS acquired new LIDAR data in spring 2015 to establish a more thorough and better quality core LIDAR dataset The LiDAR data products are suitable for 1 foot (or less) contour generation.Intensity images generated from the RPC data for the DC OCTO 2015 LiDAR project covering approximately 80 square miles, in which its extents cover Arlington County in Washington DC. Intensity is a measure, collected for every point, of the return strength of the laser pulse that generated the point. It is based, in part, on the reflectivity of the object struck by the laser pulse.  This project consists of deliverables in accordance with USGS v1.2 specifications and meets or exceeds the level of quality for QL1 (8 points per meter).",error,,error,error,,2016-02-23T19:33:26.000Z,,,Washington D.C,"-77.176,38.755,-76.896,39.035",Maryland,Municipalities Geospatial Data,District of Columbia,"City of Washington, DC",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/297c17e0191d4fc6ae78d024f54324fe,error,https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4JuB6g9n_rmOFhKcUhCWjhBSnM,,,lidar|LiDAR|TIF|mapping|point cloud|2015|ALS70|United States|Washington DC|imagery|feb2016

Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods. The date of the flight means that most trees have fully leaf-out canopies, which obscure some ground features. This flight took place during a period of high population growth and land use change.

d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0,12b-17097,Lake County Wetland Inventory,,"Download In State Plane Projection Here.?The Lake County Wetland Inventory (LCWI) maps natural and artificial 
wetlands meeting definitions established by the federal agencies who 
work with the Lake County Geographic Information System staff to 
periodically review and update it. These agencies include the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

        The 1989 federal wetland delineation standards for offsite 
wetland mapping are used. This data was last published in March of 1993.
 This update includes changes to the previous version of LCWI including:
 adjust current wetland boundaries to omit development, including roads;
 to fine tune boundary placement where that was intended by the original
 delineation, in some cases, adjust the wetland to photographic features
 / signature; delete wetlands which the committee decided were mapped in
 error - for example, trees which were mistaken for wet areas; create 
polygons for newly delineated artificial wetlands; and newly delineated 
wetlands or farmed wetlands caused by the continued deterioration of the
 agricultural drain tile system and increased runoff due to 
urbanization.

        The LCWI is a useful tool for general planning and review 
purposes, but it does not take the place of an on-site delineation by a 
certified wetland specialist.

        High resolution (1 = 100') orthorectified aerial imagery 
captured in April 2002 was used as the base for this update. Other data 
used as reference for this update include: 2004 SOIL SURVEY GEOGRAPHIC 
(SSURGO) DATABASE FOR LAKE COUNTY, IL - U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Natural Resources Conservation Service; HYDROLOGY2002 - Lake County 
GIS/Map Division; 2' topography (CONTOURS) - Lake County GIS/Map 
Division; and various years of historical aerial photography for 
clarification. By using the more recent higher resolution photography, 
the resulting updated wetland boundaries are more accurate then the 
original boundaries published in 1993.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2016-09-30T20:07:15.000Z,,,"Lake County, Illinois, United States|Illinois, United States","-88.19982978057534,42.152363629031214,-87.7558913142488,42.495831319293764",Chicago,Counties Geospatial Data,"Lake County, Illinois","Lake County, Illinois",http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0,http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0.zip,https://services3.arcgis.com/HESxeTbDliKKvec2/arcgis/rest/services/Lake_County_Wetland_Inventory/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Lake County Illinois|Water|Hydrology|Wetlands|LCWI|Surface Water|Surface Water spatial data

They were then scanned by the USGS and georeferenced by Lake County in 2007. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods. The date of the flight means that most trees have fully leaf-out canopies, which obscure some ground features. This flight took place during a period of high population growth and land use change.

Part 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the USEPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers
 to identify in advance of specific permit requests aquatic sites which 
will be considered as areas generally unsuitable for disposal of dredged
 or fill material. This process is called an Advanced Identification or 
ADID. Under the ADID process identification of an area as generally 
unsuitable for fill does not prohibit applications for permits to fill 
in these areas. Therefore the ADID designation of unsuitability is 
advisory not regulatory.

        An ADID designation lets a potential applicant know in 
advance that a proposal to fill such a site is not likely to be 
consistent with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the USEPA will probably 
request permit denial.

        ADID wetland information is also useful in watershed 
planning, land use planning, public land acquisition programs, natural 
resource studies and other purposes.

        The wetland selection criteria and methodology are documented
 in the publication entitled Advanced Identification (ADID) Study, Lake
 County, Illinois. Final Report, November 1992 which is included in 
this download.

 culverts, and streams) and the outer boundary of the water feature 
areas (for example, lakes and ponds) of Lake County, Illinois. The 
features in the dataset include: dams, culverts, local drainage; and the
 outer boundary of lakes, ponds, detention/retention basins, 
river/streams/creeks greater than five feet wide, and islands.

        The data has not been field verified and errors and/or omissions may be present.

        The names used for the water bodies were collected from a 
number of sources including: existing datasets, historic maps and/or 
atlases, US Geologic Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS),
 current and historical USGS topographic quadrangle maps, local 
publications on place names within the county, and platted subdivisions.

        The dataset was traced from aerial photography captured 
between April 13 and April 26, 2002. The water features were compiled 
using softcopy analytical stereoplotters. This dataset should meet 
National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product and it is

Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods.

Color InfraRed (CIR) imagery allows users to see the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the visible range. It does this by using the visible spectrum (red, green, blue) and combining it with the Near InfraRed (NIR) spectrum. CIR imagery is useful for determining the health of vegetation, which show up in various shades of red. It can also be helpful in identifying features like water, paved surfaces or non-vegetated areas, which appear black or grey respectively.

They were scanned in 2001, and georeferenced in 2002. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from paper prints, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as pen marks and fading. Caution should be used in interpreting features in this photography with reference to current conditions. In particular, many roads and road intersections have been realigned in the more than 60 years since this photography was taken. This historic aerial photography was captured in digital form as the result of a cooperative project between the Illinois State Geological Survey and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mapping Division of the Lake County Department of Information Technology. It is part of a statewide program to preserve the oldest known extensive aerial photography for future generations. The original photography was performed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of a nation-wide program for use in agricultural assessment. Since the original negatives became unstable and were destroyed by the National Archives in the 1980s, only paper prints remain.

2b76254a8c524ff7949f6269184279e6,12b-17097,2010 Lake County Aerial Color InfraRed (CIR) - SW Quarter,,"This six inch pixel resolution color infrared aerial photography was flown between April 9, 2010 and April 18, 2010. The files are provided in JPEG2000, an open format supported by most GIS and CAD software packages. Its intended usage for viewing is 1 = 100. The photography has been orthorectified to meet National Map Accuracy Standards for its capture scale. The images are georeferenced to the Illinois State Plane, Eastern Zone, using the NAD83 NSRS2007 horizontal datum. Color InfraRed (CIR) imagery allows users to see the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the visible range. It does this by using the visible spectrum (red, green, blue) and combining it with the Near InfraRed (NIR) spectrum.

The files are provided in JPEG2000, an open format supported by most GIS and CAD software packages. Its intended usage for viewing is 1 = 100. The photography has been orthorectified to meet National Map Accuracy Standards for its capture scale. The images are georeferenced to the Illinois State Plane, Eastern Zone, using the NAD83 NSRS2007 horizontal datum. Color InfraRed (CIR) imagery allows users to see the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the visible range. It does this by using the visible spectrum (red, green, blue) and combining it with the Near InfraRed (NIR) spectrum. CIR imagery is useful for determining the health of vegetation, which show up in various shades of red. It can also be helpful in identifying features like water, paved surfaces or non-vegetated areas, which appear black or grey respectively. The data set is tiled for dissemination into many separate tiles, each of which is 2500 feet on a side.",error,,error,error,,2018-02-02T18:12:52.000Z,,,"Lake County, Illinois, United States|Illinois, United States","-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",Chicago,Counties Geospatial Data,"Lake County, Illinois","Lake County, Illinois",http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/400dcf6823874480a4f0e065b8e96b49,error,https://s3.amazonaws.com/lakecountygis-public/aerials/LakeCounty2012CIRAerialsNW.zip,,,Orthophotography|Orthophoto|Orthoimagery|Digital orthophoto|Digital orthorectified imagery|Digital orthoimagery|High resolution orthoimagery|Imagery|Aerial photography|Satellite imagery|Air imagery|Historic aerial imagery|Color aerial imagery|Air Photo|Color InfraRed|2012|Lake County Illinois
