Led by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) in conjunction with the Office of Planning (OP) and the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), Great Streets has grown into a multi-year, multi-agency program that utilizes public actions and resources to leverage private investment in retail, office space, housing, and cultural facilities across the District. The Government of the District of Columbia through the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) administers the Great Streets Retail Small Business Reimbursement Grants, which are competitive grants of up to $50,000 for qualified small business owners who wish to improve their place of business. The purpose of the grant program is to support existing small businesses, attract new businesses, increase the District's tax base, create new job opportunities for District residents, and transform emerging commercial corridors into thriving and inviting neighborhood centers.

f88b67ddbee74ca198392bd76771a71e_1,04b-24005,Urban Rural Demarcation Line,,"Baltimore County's Urban Rural Demarcation Line (URDL) has divided the county into urban and rural areas since established by the Planning Board in 1967. Developed primarily as a growth management tool, it has influenced zoning, land-use, and infrustructure decisions, and was the baseline for the Baltimore County part of Maryland's Priority Funding Area. However, this boundary (digitized at a scale of 1:24,000 where 1 represents 2,000') was became obsolete as the county's GIS data increased in resolution (to 1:2,400 where 1 represents 200'). Until recently, determining a property's status as either urban or rural was of a highly interpretative nature. A new URDL was developed to more accurately match the 1:2,400 data (parcel, street centerline, zoning, etc). This version was reviewed and modified in a series of meetings with several interested county agencies. The new URDL removes much of the old one's ambiguity while keeping its original intent. The new URDL was reviewed, modified, and subsequently approved by the Planning Board on June 19, 2003. Minor revisions were effected 9/2/04, 10/21/04, 9/4/07, 5/21/09, 10/1/09 and 11/15/12.

Each census tract must constitute a reasonably compact, continuous land area, all parts of which are internally accessible by road. The entire area and population of a county are covered by census tracts. Census tracts are identified by four-digit numbers ranging from 0001 to 9989; a two-digit decimal suffix also may be used. Census tract numbers can NOT be used more than once in a county.

The Census Bureau works with local participants to delineate boundaries for CDPs. By defining CDPs, the Census Bureau can tabulate and disseminate data for localities that otherwise would not be identified as places in the decennial census data products. 
     Each CDP will contain an identifiable core encompassing the area that is associated strongly with the CDP name and contains the majority of the CDP's population, housing, commercial structures, and economic activity. A CDP must comprise a reasonably compact and continuous land area internally accessible to all points by road. (Except where parts of a CDP are separated by a narrow corridor of incorporated territory, or where the topography or geographic patterns of settlement are not compact, but are irregularly shaped.) A CDP may not be located partially or entirely within an incorporated place or another CDP. A CDP encompasses the surrounding closely settled territory associated with the place name. The Census Bureau does not intend for a CDP to be an apartment complex or residential subdivision in densely settled areas or simply a crossroads in rural areas.

Water quality standards are comprised of the uses (including antidegradation) that waters can support and goals established to protect those uses. Uses include aquatic life, fish consumption, potable water supply, and recreation.  The goals are numerical or narrative water quality criteria that express the in-stream levels that must be achieved to support the uses.?Periodic reports on the quality of waters in the Commonwealth are required under section 305(b) of the federal Clean Water Act. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to list all imparied waters not supporting uses even after appropriate and required water pollution control technologies have been applied.

Since 2004, PADEP has adopted an integrated format for Clean Water Act Section 305(b) reporting and Section 303(d) listing. The list of impaired streams, as well as the list of streams assessed that met the water quality standards, are found in the 2014 Pennsylvania Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report on the PADEP web page.Description of GIS data and source files:CCWRA has combined the two source files provided by PADEP (see below) so that each stream segment has only one record. Fields for each use assessment has been added to correlate to records in the previous files.?Source data sets are from?Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 2015? ? ? i.

The original data contained Urban Clusters, which were removed. The data was given a projected coordinate system, but no other changes have been made to the original source data.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.?After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the urban footprint. There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000).

This GIS Dataset is a representation of the Landscapes identified in the plan. The concept of livable landscapes provides a framework for protection and growth strategies within Chester County. The map provides a guide for accommodating expected future growth while maintaining the quality of life in the county. The Livable Landscapes map is divided into two core areas, growth areas and rural resource areas, as prescribed by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The growth areas consist of the urban landscape and the suburban landscape. The rural resource areas consist of the agricultural landscape and the rural landscape. The natural landscape exists throughout the county recognizing the important network of natural resources needing specific protection. Livable landscapes recognizes the diversity that makes Chester County a special place. Each landscape has a different character and is appropriate for different intensities and varieties of development. The urban and suburban landscapes can best accommodate future growth. The county will encourage future development to be concentrated in these landscapes. The rural and agricultural landscapes are least appropriate for intense growth. The county will not encourage development in these landscapes. Livable landscapes is not a land use map.

Notes:? 

Coordinate System:?
Pennsylvania State Plane South Zone 3702; U.S. Survey Foot

Development Notes:? This data set is a digital soil survey and
generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the
National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing,
or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This
data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute
data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a
detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that
normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be
cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer
(point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of
features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough
and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil
map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System
relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component
soils and their properties.? The soil map
and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of
the National Cooperative Soil Survey

Feature Dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled information concerning
vegetation and limited open areas of ground. The Land Use Feature Dataset
contains Woodlands, Nurseries and Orchards, Cultivated Fields and Athletic
Fields. Woodlands are groups of trees, whether coniferous or deciduous.
Woodland areas that are one (1) acre or greater in size are digitized from the
aerial photography. Nurseries and Orchards are areas that indicate cultivated
trees. These areas are usually identified because the trees are found in evenly
spaced rows. Nursery and Orchard areas that are one (1) acre or greater in size
are digitized from the aerial photography. Cultivated Fields are those areas
that are used for crops. Pasture land and land that, according to the aerial
photographs and aerial interpretation, has been permitted to lie fallow for an
extended period is not considered cultivated areas. Cultivated Field areas that
are one (1) acre or greater in size are digitized from the aerial photography.
Athletic Fields are sport fields that have a natural surface. The apparent
outline of the land area used for athletic purposes is digitized from the
aerial photography and not just the actual athletic field.

drainage features and structures including rivers, streams, drainage canals,
locks, dams, lakes, ponds, reservoirs and mooring cells.? Lakes are large standing bodies of water

than 1 acre and less than 5 acres in size. Polygons are created from Stream
edges and River Edges.? The Ohio River,
Monongahela River and Allegheny River are coded as Major River polygons.? All other River and Stream polygons are coded
as River. A Drainage Canal is a manmade or channelized hydrographic
feature.? Drainage Canals are
differentiated from streams in that drainage canals have had the sides and/or
bottom stabilized to prevent erosion for the predominant length of the
feature.? Streams may have had some
stabilization done, but are primarily in a natural state. Lakes are large
standing bodies of water greater than five acres in size.? Ponds are large standing bodies of water
greater than one acre in size and less than five acres in size.? Reservoirs are manmade embankments of
water.? Included in this definition are
both covered and uncovered water tanks. Reservoirs that are greater than one
acre in size are digitized. Hidden Streams, Hidden Rivers and Hidden Drainage
Canal or Culverts are those areas of drainage where the water flows through a
manmade facility such as a culvert. Hydrology Annotation is not being updated
but will be preserved.? If a drainage
feature has been removed, as apparent on the aerial photography, the associated
drainage name annotation will be removed. A Mooring Cell is a structure to
which tows can tie off while awaiting lockage.?
They are normally constructed of concrete and steel and are anchored to
the river bottom by means of gravity or sheet piling. Mooring Cells do not
currently exist in the Allegheny County dataset but will be added. Locks are
devices that are used to control flow or access to a hydrologic feature.? The edges of the Lock are captured.? Dams are devices that are used to hold or
