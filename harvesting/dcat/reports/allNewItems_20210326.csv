It only includes locations that have been publicly shared by agencies or providers. Some providers may have been authorized as vaccine points of distribution but have not yet received vaccine doses. In other cases, some providers may have received doses but do not have current vaccine availability. For sites that offer both COVID-19 testing and vaccination, the start date likely refers to the date they started offering COVID-19 testing. Creation dates do not reflect the date a provider began vaccinating; they only reflect the date we added them to our data.Please submit new vaccination sites or updated vaccination site information via this form:https://arcg.is/10S1ib. GISCorps volunteers verify each submission prior to including it in this public view. You can also add your sites in bulk by completing a copy ofthis templateand emailing it to admin@giscorps.org.This dataset is updated daily. All information is sourced from public information shared by health departments, local governments, and healthcare providers. The data are aggregated byGISCorps volunteers and should not be considered complete or authoritative. Please contact providers or your local health department directly for official information and vaccination eligibility requirements.The objective of this application is to aggregate and facilitate the public communications of local governments, health departments, and healthcare providers with regard to vaccination site locations. GISCorps does not share any vaccination site location information not previously made public or provided to us by one of those entities.Data dictionary document:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HlFmtsT3GzibixPR_QJiGqGOuia9r-exN3i5UK8c6h4/edit?usp=sharing",English,URISA's GISCorps,Esri,Geospatial data,,Coronavirus|COVID-19|PublicHealth|CoronavirusResponse|EmergencyResponse|ArcGISSolutions,2020-12-29T21:19:59.000Z,,,,United States,"-176.6576,-88.7180,161.6968,80.6945",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/c50a1a352e944a66aed98e61952051ef_0,https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/c50a1a352e944a66aed98e61952051ef_0.zip,,https://services.arcgis.com/8ZpVMShClf8U8dae/arcgis/rest/services/Covid19_Vaccination_Locations/FeatureServer/0,,c50a1a352e944a66aed98e61952051ef_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/c50a1a352e944a66aed98e61952051ef_0,,99-1000,99-1000,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False,2.37 MB

,State,"This layer shows place of birth by citizenship status.This is shown by tract, county, and state boundaries.This service is updated annually to contain the most currently released American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data, and contains estimates and margins of error. There are also additional calculated attributes related to this topic, which can be mapped or used within analysis. This layer is symbolized to show the predominant area of birth among those who are foreign born. To see the full list of attributes available in this service, go to the ""Data"" tab, and choose ""Fields"" at the top right.Current Vintage: 2015-2019ACS Table(s): B05002 (Not all lines of this ACS table are available in this feature layer.)Data downloaded from:Census Bureau's API for American Community SurveyDate of API call: December 10, 2020National Figures:data.census.govThe United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS):About the SurveyGeography & ACSTechnical DocumentationNews & UpdatesThis ready-to-use layer can be used within ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, its configurable apps, dashboards, Story Maps, custom apps, and mobile apps. Data can also be exported for offline workflows. Please cite the Census and ACS when using this data.Data Note from the Census:Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December. The layer always contains the latest available ACS 5-year estimates. It is updated annually within days of the Census Bureau's release schedule.Click hereto learn more about ACS data releases.Boundaries come from theUS Census TIGER geodatabases. Boundaries are updated at the same time as the data updates (annually), and the boundary vintage appropriately matches the data vintageas specified by the Census. These are Census boundaries with water and/or coastlines clipped for cartographic purposes. For census tracts, the water cutouts are derived from a subset of the 2010 AWATER (Area Water) boundaries offered by TIGER. For state and county boundaries, the water and coastlines are derived from the coastlines of the 500kTIGER Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles. The original AWATER and ALAND fields are still available as attributes within the data table (units are square meters).The States layer contains 52 records - all US states, Washington D.C., and Puerto RicoCensus tracts with no population that occur in areas of water, such as oceans, are removed from this data service (Census Tracts beginning with 99).Percentages and derived counts, and associated margins of error, are calculated values (that can be identified by the ""_calc_"" stub in the field name), and abide by the specificationsdefined by the American Community Survey.Field alias names were created based on the Table Shells file available from theAmerican Community Survey Summary File Documentation page.Negative values (e.g., -4444...) have been set to null, with the exception of -5555... which has been set to zero.These negative values exist in the raw API data to indicate the following situations:The margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error.

Lot #5 contains the full project area Dataset Description: The SANDY_Restoration_DE_MD_QL2 project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 1. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of State Plane Zone Maryland (1900), NAD83, feet and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), feet.

In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 87 Land Cover control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the Garrett County, MD project area (20 calibration control points).This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in early to mid 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. Sensor errors in mulitple locations were identified in processing, additonal acquisition on 7/20/2018 was completed to remedy the errors. 2016 lidar data was used with approval in a single area of restricted airspace. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Sanborn Map Company, Inc. established a total of 23 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 79 independent accuracy check points in Open Terrain and Urban landcovers were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

,Maryland LiDAR Allegany County - Shaded Relief,"Dewberry collected LiDAR for ~3,942 square miles in various Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland Counties. The acquisition was performed by Geodigital. This metadata covers the LiDAR produced for the Allegany County project area. The nominal pulse spacing for this project is 1.6 ft (0.5 meters). This project was collected with a sensor which collects intensity values for each discrete pulse extracted from the waveform. GPS Week Time, Intensity, Flightline and echo number attributes were provided for each LiDAR point. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to contract specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity, and 11-Withheld.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

,Maryland LiDAR Carroll County - Aspect,"MD/PA Sandy Supplemental Lidar Data Acquisition and Processing Production Task USGS Contract No. G10PC00057 Task Order No. G14PD00397 Woolpert Order No. 74333 CONTRACTOR: Woolpert, Inc. This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water.

,Maryland LiDAR Worcester County - DEM Meters,"This Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset is a survey of the Pocomoke and Atlantic Coastal Watersheds in Maryland. The project area consists of approximately 500 square miles. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 0.70 meters. Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 151 flight lines in eight lifts on February 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 16, 2011; in tidal areas, data was collected within 2 hours (before or after) of mean low tide. The data was divided into 1500 by 1500 meter cells that serve as the tiling scheme. LiDAR data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS60 MPiA sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform.

Areas of interest were defined by the State. All aerial imagery was acquired using ADS direct digital sensors at an altitude sufficient for the production of digital orthophotos with a 1.0-foot or .5-foot pixel resolution as requested. Following acquisition of imagery data, survey ground control coordinates were used in-conjunction with Airborne GPS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) information to establish precise spatial positioning of the image data through the process of Analytical Aero-Triangulation (AT). Upon completion of AT, the imagery was rectified to the best available digital elevation model (DEM), whether from the USGS, other high quality DEM provided by the participating government in GeoTIFF or other compatible format, or new ADS stereo imagery compiled and edited surface model using Pictovera software. The resultant rectified imagery was analyzed and radiometrically adjusted to provide the state with optimal color and tonal appearance. Manually-placed seamlines were generated to mosaic imagery from adjacent flightlines. Following mosaicking and color-balancing, multiple QA/QC processes were performed to insure optimal data quality was achieved prior to tiling the data to 5,000 by 5,000 pixel extents. All ortho tiles were clipped to an AOI shapefile (buffered to 400-meters) boundaries, as supplied by the State of Michigan.

Manually check this link!,Crawford County Municipal Boundaries,"This data contains boundary information for the municipalities of Crawford County, PA. The data were created according to the Crawford County Planning Office's interpretation of maps researched and drawn by the County Planning Office in the late 1970s and 1980s, corroborated by official zoning maps. The GIS information is more precise than the print maps, which implies a false accuracy of the data. The boundaries are not surveyed, and the data are adjusted to fit with other County data already on file and changes to boundaries through court-ordered corrections or annexations from that time. The following rules were generally applied during digitization from the print maps to GIS: 1) Where boundary information was clearly represented as following a right-of-way edge, the edge was followed. 2) Where boundaries appeared to follow a right-of-way centerline or did not clearly follow a right-of-way edge, the boundaries were conformed to the GIS centerline and most often meet it at a perpendicular. Where right-of-ways appear with no existing GIS centerline, the centerline is estimated. 3) Where boundaries appear to cross roads at clear angles, the boundary line direction was retained and did not meet the road perpendicularly. 4) Where boundaries appeared to follow parcel lines, they were made to conform to parcel lines unless it would significantly distort the geometry or intended direction of the boundary line. Where boundary lines appeared to deliberately maintain a geometry, shape, or direction, the parcel lines were disregarded in favor of maintaining the boundary geometry. 5) Where boundaries appeared to clearly follow a water feature, the boundary was formed around what could be seen of that feature by 2014 PMAP orthographic photo-imagery if the feature did not also conform to a parcel boundary. For streams that form parcel boundaries, the centerline is estimated as a compromise between GIS parcel data and photo-imagery, unless egregious discrepancies lead either parcel data or photo imagry to be favored for practicality.",English,Crawford County Government,"Crawford County, Pennsylvania",Geospatial data,,Municipal|Municipality|Township|Borough|Boro|Twp|Boundaries|Borders|CrawfordCounty|County,2021-03-09T01:24:02.000Z,,,,"Venango County, Pennsylvania|Meadville, Pennsylvania|Crawford County, Pennsylvania|Titusville, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania","-80.5185,41.4716,-79.6124,41.8677",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://share-open-data-crawfordcountypa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/849c6689d3364943869312a272bd3ab8_0,https://share-open-data-crawfordcountypa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/849c6689d3364943869312a272bd3ab8_0.zip,https://ccgis.crawfordcountypa.net/arcgis/rest/services/Craw_Internal/CrawfordCountyMunicipalBoundaries_internal/MapServer/0,,,849c6689d3364943869312a272bd3ab8_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/849c6689d3364943869312a272bd3ab8_0,Pennsylvania State University,08b-42039,08b-42039,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False,0.0354 MB
