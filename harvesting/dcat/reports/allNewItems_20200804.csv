,Crawford County Municipal Boundaries,"This data contains boundary information for the municipalities of Crawford County, PA. The data were created according to the Crawford County Planning Office's interpretation of maps researched and drawn by the County Planning Office in the late 1970s and 1980s, corroborated by official zoning maps. The GIS information is more precise than the print maps, which implies a false accuracy of the data. The boundaries are not surveyed, and the data are adjusted to fit with other County data already on file and changes to boundaries through court-ordered corrections or annexations from that time. The following rules were generally applied during digitization from the print maps to GIS: 1) Where boundary information was clearly represented as following a right-of-way edge, the edge was followed. 2) Where boundaries appeared to follow a right-of-way centerline or did not clearly follow a right-of-way edge, the boundaries were conformed to the GIS centerline and most often meet it at a perpendicular. Where right-of-ways appear with no existing GIS centerline, the centerline is estimated. 3) Where boundaries appear to cross roads at clear angles, the boundary line direction was retained and did not meet the road perpendicularly. 4) Where boundaries appeared to follow parcel lines, they were made to conform to parcel lines unless it would significantly distort the geometry or intended direction of the boundary line. Where boundary lines appeared to deliberately maintain a geometry, shape, or direction, the parcel lines were disregarded in favor of maintaining the boundary geometry. 5) Where boundaries appeared to clearly follow a water feature, the boundary was formed around what could be seen of that feature by 2014 PMAP orthographic photo-imagery if the feature did not also conform to a parcel boundary. For streams that form parcel boundaries, the centerline is estimated as a compromise between GIS parcel data and photo-imagery, unless egregious discrepancies lead either parcel data or photo imagry to be favored for practicality.",English,Crawford County Government,"Crawford County, Pennsylvania",Geospatial data,,Municipal|Municipality|Township|Borough|Boro|Twp|Boundaries|Borders|CrawfordCounty|County|Municipalities,2019-07-11T17:10:04.000Z,,,,"Crawford County, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania","-80.5185,41.4716,-79.6124,41.8677",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,http://share-open-data-crawfordcountypa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/afdc92bb82044476accdad5b894b71e6_0,http://share-open-data-crawfordcountypa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/afdc92bb82044476accdad5b894b71e6_0.zip,https://ccgis.crawfordcountypa.net/arcgis/rest/services/Crawford_Web/CrawfordCountyMunicipalBoundaries/MapServer/0,,,afdc92bb82044476accdad5b894b71e6_0,Penn State,08b-42039,08b-42039,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Scoping Park and Ride,"Several layers were examined as part of the highway improvement needs analysis conducted for the 2017 State Transportation plan.Existing and candidate park and ride lots in the state of Iowa, represented as linear features. Features were created using a 2-mile buffer around each lot to represent primary routes that could potentially be viable (re)locations for park and ride lots. 2-miles was selected for the buffer area based on the FHWA report ""Safety Assessment of Interchange Spacing on Urban Freeways"" publication number FHWA-HRT-07-031. https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/07031/The Iowa Department of Transportation's park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT's district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities. In 2014, The Iowa Park and Ride System Plan was developed. This plan includes an update of the existing inventory, an identification of additional locations suitable for park and ride facilities, and strategies for implementation .The plan will be used by the Iowa DOT to plan, evaluate, and develop a formal state-owned-and-operated system of park and ride facilities. The primary objective of the plan is to provide a location-specific, priority-based park and ride system that allows for coordinated planning and implementation of park and ride facilities. As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",English,Iowa Department of Transportation,State of Iowa,Geospatial data,,IowaDepartmentofTransportation|IowaDOT|Scoping|Assets|Inventory|AssetClassification,2020-07-28T15:18:27.000Z,,,,Iowa,"-96.4773,40.6977,-90.5004,43.4577",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/de922f9b2ed34e5d8d2236ff4928b250_0,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/de922f9b2ed34e5d8d2236ff4928b250_0.zip,,https://services.arcgis.com/8lRhdTsQyJpO52F1/arcgis/rest/services/Scoping_Park_and_Ride_View/FeatureServer/0,,de922f9b2ed34e5d8d2236ff4928b250_0,Iowa,03a-02,03a-02,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

A combination of INRIX travel time data and input from internal and external stakeholders was used to identify bottleneck locations. Bottlenecks were then ranked through an analysis of each location's value, condition, and performance (VCAP). Value was based on how much each location increased the efficiency of the highway network for trucks; condition was based on the Infrastructure Condition Evaluation (ICE) tool's analysis of condition and traffic data; and performance was based on the INRIX bottleneck ranking tool. Locations were ranked, with annual average truck traffic data being used as a tiebreaker.
