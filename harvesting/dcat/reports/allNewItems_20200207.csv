bc3a6edaab594f9a90737f2a2f9c9585_3,06a-02,Trout and Salmon Inland Stream Regulation Types (Layer 1 of 4) - BTRA Polygons,,"Features from the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) were used to depict inland stream trout and salmon Brook Trout Restoration Area (polygon) type regulations for 2019-2020. NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200 and FO 210. Except for streams in the Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters, any other inland stream not classified by type (1-4; GR, RA, BTRA, 10BKT) are still subject to trout and salmon fishing regulations as described on page 40 of the Michigan Fishing Guide. Please see pp. 24-25 for Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters regulations. Note that the 4 inland stream trout and salmon regulation type GIS layers only show the streams classified by type; these layers do not include any streams that are not classified by type. The regulation type associated with a stream feature is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated). Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types. Regulation types are as follows: 1 - Type 1 Trout Stream; 2 - Type 2 Trout Stream; 3 - Type 3 Trout Stream; 4 - Type 4 Trout Stream; 10BKT - 10 Brook Trout Stream; BTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration Area; RA - Research Area Trout Stream; GR - Gear Restricted Stream. Designation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, RA, 10BKT, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. The main layer shows the majority of inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations. However, streams with multiple types will have additional features in the BTRA lines, BTRA polygon or the dual regulation layers. To show all inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations, all four layers must be displayed in the proper order using established symbology. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA polygon, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom. When displaying with inland trout and salmon lakes Types A-F and Special Type, all four of the stream layers should be displayed underneath the Types A-F and Special Type layer. For the main regulation type layer, set the drawing order so that specific regulations type display on top of others. Do this by opening the feature class properties in the Table of Contents in ArcMap, then go to Symbology, then Advanced, then Symbol levels and using the following order, from top to bottom: GR, RA, 4_0, 4_1, 3_0, 3_1, 2_1, 10BKT, 1_1.

The statewide Michigan Hydrography Framework (version?)

Lake polygons present in this layer were edited (shape, attributes, location, duplicate representations for a lake in multiple counties), created for lakes that were detemined to be missing, and adjusted to reflect our current knowledge of the waterbodies throughout the state. For each lake (~10 acres or larger), a ""New-Key"" was assigned, based upon Humphrys and Green (1962).

6c70d3b0b8b544a0b22c919aa649458a_10,06a-02,Michigan Great Lakes Grids,,"In
the Great Lakes, grid systems defined by latitude and longitude minutes have
been used for a number of decades as a fishery standard for data reporting. The
Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Fisheries Division created this
GIS layer in 2019 to depict the MDNR Michigan Great Lakes grid (v3.2) standard
for Fisheries Division applications for the waters of the State of Michigan,
and for Canadian waters in the St. Clair Detroit River System (SCDRS), as of
June 2019. This GIS layer was created by incorporating grid boundaries and ID
values from a number of existing grid standards.?This layer is a composite grid
that incorporates grid boundaries and ID values from the following GIS data
standards for different areas of the Great Lakes: 1) 10-minute grids for Lakes
Huron, Michigan, Superior and the St. Mary?s River came from the Institute for
Fisheries Research (IFR) version 1 (v1) of the 10-minute grids. 2) 10-minute
grids for Lake Erie came from version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids created by
the Great Lakes GIS (GLGIS) project, and 3) 5-minute grids for SCDRS came from
5-minute grids developed by the GLGIS project.?Version 1 of the IFR 10-minute
grids were created in 1998, and only covered the water bodies listed above
(Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, and the St. Mary?s River). This is the
GIS dataset that was used as the grid standard for the 2000 consent decree. The
grid boundaries and ID values in v1 were originally based off paper maps, but
the publication source of the paper maps is unknown. In v1, 10-minute grids do
not always have rectangular boundaries where each side represents 10-minutes of
latitude and longitude, especially near the shoreline. In order to create the
v3.2 composite layer, some features in the v1 GIS dataset that were missing ID
values were assigned ID values based on historical creel maps or nearby grid ID
values.?Version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids was created in 2006 and provides
coverage forall five Great Lakes, but only partial coverage in the connecting
channels, with no coverage in SCDRS. In contrast to v1, 10-minute grids in this
dataset are true 10-minute grids with rectangular sides that strictly follow
10-minute latitude and longitude lines (along with some cases where two true
10-minute grids were combined into one grid cell with one ID value). Due to the
differences in grid boundaries, there are some different ID values across v1
and v2.?The GLGIS 5-minute grid GIS dataset was created in 2006 at IFR. This
layer contains rectangular 5-minute grids that are true 5-minute grids, with
each side of every grid representing 5-minutes of latitude or longitude.
5-minute grids were used for SCDRS in v3.2 to align with historical data
reporting standards in the region, and because there are no 10-minute grids
that fully cover SCDRS. 5-minute grids created by the GLGIS only exist for
SCDRS, Lake Erie, and Lake Huron, and the reason for this is unknown.?SCDRS
grids on the Canadian side of the basin are included in v3.2 for Fisheries
Division data reporting needs that may include Canadian areas of SCDRS, but
these grids in Canadian waters may not represent the standard that is actively
used by Canadian agencies.?In order to create the v3.2 composite, grid cells
from the various GIS data sources were merged together for water bodies as
specified above. In v3.2 the grids are almost exactly as they appear in the
source data (with minor edits such as edge matching) except where 10-minute
grids 602 and 603 in Lake Erie from Version 2 were replaced with GLGIS 5-minute
grids. These grids cover the transition between the Detroit River and Lake
Erie, where 10-minute grids are too large for some fisheries data reporting
purposes. Therefore in v3.2, the two 10-minute grids were replaced with four
5-minute grids from the GLGIS 5-minute grid dataset. ID values were kept from
the 5-minute grids for the two northern cells but thetwo southern grids cells
retain ID values from the GLGIS v2 10-minute grids (602 and 603). This was done
to allow continuity with historical data that has been recorded for 10-minute
grids 602 and 603, but users need to be aware that these ID values in v3.2 are
now associated with 5-minute grids instead of 10-minute grids.GIS layer was

1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3,06a-02,Base Flow of Michigan Streams,,"This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2017-04-27T12:21:24.000Z,,,Michigan,"-167.0934,69.4683,173.9906,76.1809",Michigan State,Michigan DNR,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3,"http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":3078,""wkid"":102123}",https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,,MapServer,Michigan|DNR|Open Data|Fishing|Hydrology|Hydrography|Flow|Flows|Rivers|Streams|Morphology

and (see webpage http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825---,00.html and subpage on hunting / wildlife
information at http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825_51108---,00.html ).?
Users may require only walking assistance devices or may be those with
specific wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs), or other
motorized-type vehicles.? 

Please
check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to
what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment
legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are
allowed on all areas of Michigan?s public land managed by the DNR.

?

Accessible
features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no
stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal
assistive mobility devices (PAMDs).? All
buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are
fully ADA compliant and accessible.? It
is the more natural features being identified in this layer.? Many of these features are fully ADA code
compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are
regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the
low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR
Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2016-10-27T15:25:26.000Z,,,Michigan,"-169.6425,71.3359,177.0476,74.8962",Michigan State,Michigan DNR,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bbd38e254c3a40a498678a1f59c38f72_9,"http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bbd38e254c3a40a498678a1f59c38f72_9.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":3078,""wkid"":102123}",https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/DNR/dnrWildlife/MapServer/9,,MapServer,dnr|hunting|wildlife|accessible|low-slope|features|PAMD|fish & wildlife

45026acc949e41e5ae2130e7218be6fb_2,06a-02,Trout and Salmon Inland Stream Regulation Types (Layer 4 of 4) - BTRA Lines,,"Features from the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) were used to depict inland stream trout and salmon Brook Trout Restoration Area (lines) type regulations for 2019-2020. NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200 and FO 210. Except for streams in the Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters, any other inland stream not classified by type (1-4; GR, RA, BTRA, 10BKT) are still subject to trout and salmon fishing regulations as described on page 40 of the Michigan Fishing Guide. Please see pp. 24-25 for Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters regulations. Note that the 4 inland stream trout and salmon regulation type GIS layers only show the streams classified by type; these layers do not include any streams that are not classified by type. The regulation type associated with a stream feature is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated). Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types. Regulation types are as follows: 1 - Type 1 Trout Stream; 2 - Type 2 Trout Stream; 3 - Type 3 Trout Stream; 4 - Type 4 Trout Stream; 10BKT - 10 Brook Trout Stream; BTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration Area; RA - Research Area Trout Stream; GR - Gear Restricted Stream. Designation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, RA, 10BKT, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. The main layer shows the majority of inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations. However, streams with multiple types will have additional features in the BTRA lines, BTRA polygon or the dual regulation layers. To show all inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations, all four layers must be displayed in the proper order using established symbology. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA polygon, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom. When displaying with inland trout and salmon lakes Types A-F and Special Type, all four of the stream layers should be displayed underneath the Types A-F and Special Type layer. For the main regulation type layer, set the drawing order so that specific regulations type display on top of others.

story map represents a sample of the habitat development projects around the
state that are funded by your license dollars. Your hunting and fishing license
purchases significantly impact the quality of habitat for Michigan's fish and
wildlife, and by opening the interactive map and clicking on a point, you can
now get background information on how your contribution benefits the resources
of our great state!

?

Most Michigan
residents know the Department of Natural Resources is responsible for things
like fish and wildlife management, hunting and fishing regulations, and habitat
protection, but many don't know where the funding for these efforts comes from.
You may assume that your tax dollars fund the DNR's conservation work, but in
reality, only a small portion of the DNR's funding comes from General Fund
(tax) dollars. The protection, preservation and management of Michigan's
natural resources have been primarily funded by the people who hunt and fish
through their purchase of equipment and licenses.

?

If you're a hunter
or angler, have bought a license or hunting/fishing equipment, thank you for
investing in Michigan's wildlife! If you know a hunter or angler, pass on this
message and thank them for everything they have done for conservation in Michigan.
Their efforts have resulted in millions of acres of habitat saved and
near-miraculous population increases in several species of game and sport fish.
You can enjoy more hunting, fishing, boating and wildlife-related recreational
opportunities than ever before thanks to hunters and anglers!",Flagged,,ArcGIS Hub Dataset|Esri Rest API,,,2017-02-07T15:23:02.000Z,,,Michigan,"-93.348,40.168,-80.341,49.259",Michigan State,Michigan DNR,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c45385db5bb5426980417dafe87bad1f,,https://www.midnr.com/Publications/pdfs/ArcGISOnline/interactivemaps/licenserevenue/,,,license|revenue|project|dnr|michigan|your|dollars|work|Fishing|Forestry|Hunting|Recreation|Wildlife

low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR
Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2016-10-27T15:23:30.000Z,,,Michigan,"-168.1087,69.841,171.3766,76.0615",Michigan State,Michigan DNR,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cc49db9fd8a4469f981dc8df39ba3d75_8,"http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cc49db9fd8a4469f981dc8df39ba3d75_8.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":3078,""wkid"":102123}",https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/DNR/dnrWildlife/MapServer/8,,MapServer,dnr|hunting|wildlife|accessible|low-slope|features|PAMD|fish & wildlife

Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) does have many locations or
features which help or particularly benefit those public users, photography
enthusiasts, birdwatchers, or hunters who have special mobility needs and
benefit from special accessible conditions to reach our outdoor and wildlife
resources.? The DNR website has details
and a wide variety of accessible, ADA compliant rules, guidelines and features
and (see webpage http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825---,00.html and subpage on hunting / wildlife
information at http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825_51108---,00.html ).?
Users may require only walking assistance devices or may be those with
specific wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs), or other
motorized-type vehicles.? 

Please
check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to
what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment
legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are
allowed on all areas of Michigan?s public land managed by the DNR.

?

Accessible
features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no
stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal
assistive mobility devices (PAMDs).? All
buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are
fully ADA compliant and accessible.? It
is the more natural features being identified in this layer.? Many of these features are fully ADA code
compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are
regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the
low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR
Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2016-10-26T15:39:28.000Z,,,Michigan,"-168.121,69.9036,171.5535,76.0584",Michigan State,Michigan DNR,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6a4017135ea54a21aabb0f48b8ba1630_7,"http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6a4017135ea54a21aabb0f48b8ba1630_7.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":3078,""wkid"":102123}",https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/DNR/dnrWildlife/MapServer/7,,MapServer,dnr|hunting|wildlife|accessible|low-slope|features|PAMD|fish & wildlife

afbd514737e14ea3bdbdb428aeb2d904_0,06a-02,Trout and Salmon Inland Stream Regulation Types (Layer 2 of 4) - Dual,,"Features from the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) were used to depict inland stream trout and salmon dual regulations for 2019-2020. NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200 and FO 210. Except for streams in the Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters, any other inland stream not classified by type (1-4; GR, RA, BTRA, 10BKT) are still subject to trout and salmon fishing regulations as described on page 40 of the Michigan Fishing Guide. Please see pp. 24-25 for Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters regulations. Note that the 4 inland stream trout and salmon regulation type GIS layers only show the streams classified by type; these layers do not include any streams that are not classified by type. The regulation type associated with a stream feature is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated). Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types. Regulation types are as follows: 1 - Type 1 Trout Stream; 2 - Type 2 Trout Stream; 3 - Type 3 Trout Stream; 4 - Type 4 Trout Stream; 10BKT - 10 Brook Trout Stream; BTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration Area; RA - Research Area Trout Stream; GR - Gear Restricted Stream. Designation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, RA, 10BKT, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. The main layer shows the majority of inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations. However, streams with multiple types will have additional features in the BTRA lines, BTRA polygon or the dual regulation layers. To show all inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations, all four layers must be displayed in the proper order using established symbology. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA polygon, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom. When displaying with inland trout and salmon lakes Types A-F and Special Type, all four of the stream layers should be displayed underneath the Types A-F and Special Type layer. For the main regulation type layer, set the drawing order so that specific regulations type display on top of others. Do this by opening the feature class properties in the Table of Contents in ArcMap, then go to Symbology, then Advanced, then Symbol levels and using the following order, from top to bottom: GR, RA, 4_0, 4_1, 3_0, 3_1, 2_1, 10BKT, 1_1.

of the land. We met them while developing landscape stewardship plans in
Michigan. Landscape stewardship plans are voluntary forest management plans for
large areas.

With funding provided by the U.S. Forest Service, those involved in the project developed nine landscape
stewardship plans in three very diverse regions in Michigan. Each landscape
stewardship plan describes the forest resources in a one to four county region
and includes a collection of ten stories that highlight a variety of forest
management practices for other landowners to consider.

This innovative
project combines the strengths of multiple organizations to enhance public and
private partnerships for sustainable forest management in nine landscapes that
span 8 million acres throughout Michigan. These landscape stewardship plans
help us to better engage private landowners by sharing stories that inspire
them to become active managers of their own forest land.?",Flagged,,ArcGIS Hub Dataset|Esri Rest API,,,2017-05-05T12:13:37.000Z,,,Michigan,"-93.348,40.168,-80.341,49.259",Michigan State,Michigan DNR,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,http://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cfc543d7ae294dfc9c8bff0555480757,,https://midnr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=cfc543d7ae294dfc9c8bff0555480757,,,landscape|stewardship|forest|DNR|Michigan|Michigan DNR|landscape stewardship plans|stewardship stories|Story Map|Story Map Journal|Story Map Series

NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200 and FO 210. Except for streams in the Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters, any other inland stream not classified by type (1-4; GR, RA, BTRA, 10BKT) are still subject to trout and salmon fishing regulations as described on page 40 of the Michigan Fishing Guide. Please see pp. 24-25 for Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters regulations. Note that the 4 inland stream trout and salmon regulation type GIS layers only show the streams classified by type; these layers do not include any streams that are not classified by type. The regulation type associated with a stream feature is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated). Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types. Regulation types are as follows:1 - Type 1 Trout Stream; 2 - Type 2 Trout Stream; 3 - Type 3 Trout Stream; 4 - Type 4 Trout Stream; 10BKT - 10 Brook Trout Stream; BTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration Area; RA - Research Area Trout Stream; GR - Gear Restricted Stream. Designation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, RA, 10BKT, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. The main layer shows the majority of inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations. However, streams with multiple types will have additional features in the BTRA lines, BTRA polygon or the dual regulation layers. To show all inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations, all four layers must be displayed in the proper order using established symbology. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA polygon, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom. When displaying with inland trout and salmon lakes Types A-F and Special Type, all four of the stream layers should be displayed underneath the Types A-F and Special Type layer. For the main regulation type layer, set the drawing order so that specific regulations type display on top of others. Do this by opening the feature class properties in the Table of Contents in ArcMap, then go to Symbology, then Advanced, then Symbol levels and using the following order, from top to bottom: GR, RA, 4_0, 4_1, 3_0, 3_1, 2_1, 10BKT, 1_1.

Features were created using a 2-mile buffer around each lot to represent primary routes that could potentially be viable (re)locations for park and ride lots. 2-miles was selected for the buffer area based on the FHWA report Safety Assessment of Interchange Spacing on Urban Freeways publication number FHWA-HRT-07-031. https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/07031/The Iowa Department of Transportation?s park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT?s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities. In 2014, The Iowa Park and Ride System Plan was developed. This plan includes an update of the existing inventory, an identification of additional locations suitable for park and ride facilities, and strategies for implementation .The plan will be used by the Iowa DOT to plan, evaluate, and develop a formal state-owned-and-operated system of park and ride facilities. The primary objective of the plan is to provide a location-specific, priority-based park and ride system that allows for coordinated planning and implementation of park and ride facilities. As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2020-01-14T20:25:15.000Z,,,Iowa,"-96.4773,40.6977,-90.5004,43.4577",Iowa,State of Iowa,Iowa Department of Transportation,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3852cc1b0d224b20810187d576dbb6bf_0,"http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3852cc1b0d224b20810187d576dbb6bf_0.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":3857,""wkid"":102100}",https://services.arcgis.com/8lRhdTsQyJpO52F1/arcgis/rest/services/Scoping_Park_and_Ride_View/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Iowa Department of Transportation|Iowa DOT|Scoping|Assets|Inventory|Asset Classification

The location maps were georeferenced to provide an approximate location for the cemeteries. Aerial Imagery, USGS Quads, MD SDAT, Plat Records, and Pictometry were used to located the cemeteries. The Name, Place Name, and Reference Number field contents were taken directly from the Holdcraft books.  The Location Type field describes the quality of the GIS location, Located, Approximate Location, or Location Unknown. Located cemeteries are either platted or clearly visible and discernable in aerial imagery. Approximately located cemeteries could not be precisely located through plat or located with any confidence using aerial imagery; their spatial location was collected directly from the georeferenced 'Names In Stone' location maps. These mainly comprise family cemeteries/burials.  Location unknown cemeteries were referenced but not located in the 'Names In Stone' maps and comprise 4 locations that are outside of Frederick County.
