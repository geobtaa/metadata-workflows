projected numbers of Plug-In Electrical Vehicles (PEVs) at the municipal level
for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey. The municipal PEV counts were aggregated
from the census block group counts, assigning the counts from each block group
to the municipality housing that block group?s centroid. The future PEV projections are based on a scenario in which 5 percent
of passenger vehicles in Pennsylvania (or about 400,000 vehicles) are PEVs.




The following datasets were used to obtain
these results using the EV Planning Toolkit:

numbers of Plug-In Electrical Vehicles (PEVs) at the census block group level
for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
future PEV projections are based on a scenario in which 5 percent of passenger
vehicles in Pennsylvania (or about 400,000 vehicles) are PEVs. 

?This dataset also includes data projecting
workplace charging demand in number of charging events and kilowatt-hours of
demand by census block group based on the aforementioned PEV projections for
the following three scenarios: 

workplace charging
     is free, workplace
     charging is the same cost as home charging, andworkplace
     charging is twice the cost of home charging.

c9f7b78de9174ea69dc54abf5f7dc40a_0,04f-01,New Jersey - Plug-In Electrical Vehicle Block Group level data,,"New Jersey Census Block Group level results from the DVRPC/UC Davis EV Planning Toolkit for ArcGIS. Visit the Story Map here. This dataset contains current (2017) and
projected numbers of Plug-In Electrical Vehicles (PEVs) at the census block
group level for the State of New Jersey. The
future PEV projections are based on a scenario in which 330,000 passenger
vehicles in New Jersey (or about 10 percent) are PEVs. 

?This dataset also includes data projecting
workplace charging demand in number of charging events and kilowatt-hours of
demand by census block group based on the aforementioned PEV projections for
the following three scenarios: 

workplace
     charging is free, workplace
     charging is the same cost as home charging, andworkplace
     charging is twice the cost of home charging. 

?The following datasets were used to obtain
these results using the EV Planning Toolkit:

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.

The contours are created using controlled and tested methods to limit the amount of error introduced during contour production but smoothing applied to the contours does introduce some deviation from the original source lidar and bare earth DEM. The contours were produced from the raster bare earth DEM and inherit the accuracy of the DEM.The project specifications require the accuracy (ACCz) of the derived DEM be calculated and reported in two ways: 1. The required NVA is: 19.6 cm (0.64 ft) at a 95% confidence level, derived according to NSSDA, i.e., based on RMSE of 10 cm (0.33 ft) in the ?bare earth? and urban land cover classes. This is a required accuracy. The NVA was tested with 116 checkpoints located in bare earth and urban (non-vegetated) areas. 2. Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (VVA): VVA shall be reported for brushlands/low trees and tall weeds/crops land cover classes. The target VVA is: 29.4 cm (0.96 ft) at the 95th percentile, derived according to ASPRS Guidelines, Vertical Accuracy Reporting for Lidar Data, i.e., based on the 95th percentile error in all vegetated land cover classes combined. This is a target accuracy. The VVA was tested with 79 checkpoints located in tall weeds/crops and brushlands/low trees (vegetated) areas. The checkpoints were distributed throughout the project area and were surveyed using GPS techniques. See survey report for additional survey methodologies. AccuracyZ has been tested to meet 19.6 cm (0.64 ft) or better Non-Vegetated Vertical Accuracy at 95% confidence level using RMSE(z) x 1.9600 as defined by the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA); assessed and reported using National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP)/ASRPS Guidelines.",Flagged,,ArcGIS Hub Dataset|Esri Rest API,,,2020-04-07T13:05:56.000Z,,,"Lake County, Illinois|Illinois","-88.215,42.158,-87.781,42.493",Chicago,"Lake County, Illinois",Lake County Illinois GIS,http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2b3284f6bbf44e68b6996c5db05b229b,,https://lakecountygis-public.s3.amazonaws.com/topography/Contours2017.zip,,,Topography|Surface model|Triangulated irregular network|TIN|Terrain|3D|Elevation|Contours|Lake County Illinois

Similarly, greenhouse gases associated with District Government operations fell 24% since 2006 and 9% since 2013, for a total of 519,636 metric tons in 2016. These reductions were driven by lower emissions from buildings and facilities, partly due to the cleaner regional electric grid.

1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0,04c-01,Definitive Healthcare: USA Hospital Beds,,"Note:?This dataset is intended to be
used as a baseline for understanding the typical bed capacity and average yearly bed utilization?of hospitals reporting such
information. The date of last update received from each hospital may be varied.
While the dataset is not updated in real-time, this information is critical for
understanding the impact of a high utilization event, like COVID-19.Definitive Healthcare?is the leading provider of data, intelligence, and analytics on healthcare organizations and practitioners. In this service, Definitive Healthcare provides intelligence on the numbers of licensed beds, staffed beds, ICU beds, and the bed utilization rate for the hospitals in the United States. Please see the following for more details about each metric,?data was last updated on 4 May 2020:Number of Licensed Beds:??is the maximum number of beds for which a hospital holds a license to operate; however, many hospitals do not operate all the beds for which they are licensed. This number is obtained through DHC Primary Research. Licensed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of licensed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System.?Number of Staffed Beds:? is defined as an adult bed, pediatric bed, birthing room, or newborn ICU bed (excluding newborn bassinets) maintained in a patient care area for lodging patients in acute, long term, or domiciliary areas of the hospital.? Beds in labor room, birthing room, post-anesthesia, postoperative recovery rooms, outpatient areas, emergency rooms, ancillary departments, nurses and other staff residences, and other such areas which are regularly maintained and utilized for only a portion of the stay of patients (primarily for special procedures or not for inpatient lodging) are?not?termed a bed for these purposes.? Definitive Healthcare sources Staffed Bed data from the Medicare Cost Report or Proprietary Research as needed.?As with all Medicare Cost Report metrics, this number is self-reported by providers. Staffed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of staffed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System.? Total number of staffed beds in the US should exclude Hospital Systems to avoid double counting.? ICU beds are likely to follow the same logic as a subset of Staffed beds.?Number of ICU Beds -?ICU (Intensive Care Unit) Beds:? are qualified ICU based on definitions by?CMS, Section 2202.7, 22-8.2. These beds include ICU beds, psychiatric ICU beds, and Detox ICU beds.Adult ICU Beds (Legacy):?In an emergency situation, hospitals may use additional intensive care beds to supplement an influx of patients.? This number consists of all ICU beds,?burn ICU beds, surgical ICU beds, or trauma ICU beds minus any pediatric,?premature or neonatal ICU beds.Pediatric ICU Beds: are?a combination of neonatal, pediatric and premature ICU beds.Average Ventilator Usage: is the average number of patients on a ventilator per week based on an analysis of 2016-2019 Medicare  commercial claims volumes by Definitive Healthcare.?Bed Utilization Rate:? ?is calculated based on metrics from the Medicare Cost Report: Bed Utilization Rate = Total Patient Days (excluding nursery days)/Bed Days AvailablePotential Increase in Bed Capacity:?This metric is computed by subtracting??Number of Staffed Beds from?Number of Licensed beds? (Licensed Beds ? Staffed Beds).?This would provide insights into scenario planning for when staff can be shifted around to increase available bed capacity as needed.??Hospital Definition:? Definitive Healthcare defines a hospital as a healthcare institution providing inpatient, therapeutic, or rehabilitation services under the supervision of physicians. In order for a facility to be considered a hospital it must provide inpatient care.??Hospital types are defined by the last four digits of the hospital?s Medicare Provider Number. If the hospital does not have a Medicare Provider Number, Definitive Healthcare determines the Hospital type by proprietary research.?Hospital Types:??????????Short Term Acute Care Hospital (STAC)o????Provides inpatient care and other services for surgery, acute medical conditions, or injurieso????Patients care can be provided overnight, and average length of stay is less than 25 days??????????Critical Access Hospital (CAH)o????25 or fewer acute care inpatient bedso????Located more than 35 miles from another hospitalo????Annual average length of stay is 96 hours or less for acute care patientso????Must provide 24/7 emergency care serviceso????Designation by CMS to reduce financial vulnerability of rural hospitals and improve access to healthcare??????????Religious Non-Medical Health Care Institutionso????Provide nonmedical health care items and services to people who need hospital or skilled nursing facility care, but for whom that care would be inconsistent with their religious beliefs??????????Long Term Acute Care Hospitalso????Average length of stay is more than 25 dayso????Patients are receiving acute care - services often include respiratory therapy, head trauma treatment, and pain management??????????Rehabilitation Hospitalso????Specializes in improving or restoring patients' functional abilities through therapies??????????Children?s Hospitalso????Majority of inpatients under 18 years old??????????Psychiatric Hospitalso????Provides inpatient services for diagnosis and treatment of mental illness 24/7o????Under the supervision of a physician??????????Veteran's Affairs (VA) Hospital?o????Responsible for the care of war veterans and other retired military personnelo????Administered by the U.S. VA, and funded by the federal government??????????Department of Defense (DoD) Hospitalo????Provides care for military service people (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard), their dependents, and retirees (not all military service retirees are eligible for VA services)?For more information please visit -?https://www.definitivehc.com/?- or contact?sales@definitivehc.com",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2020-03-19T01:31:54.000Z,,,"Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia|Maryland|Virginia","-170.6858,-14.2902,145.7242,71.2989",Maryland,"Washington, District of Columbia",Definitive Healthcare,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0,"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":4326,""wkid"":4326}",https://services7.arcgis.com/LXCny1HyhQCUSueu/arcgis/rest/services/Definitive_Healthcare_USA_Hospital_Beds/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Definitive Healthcare|licensed beds|Hospital staffed beds|ICU beds|COVID-19|COVID-19 Respose
