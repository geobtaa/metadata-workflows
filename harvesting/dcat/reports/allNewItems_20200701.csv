,Facility Mapping Solutions for COVID-19 Recovery,"With the White House release of guidelines for states to reopen and employees to gradually return to work, facilities are tasked with complex challenges. Managers must make decisions to ensure a safe work environment and adhere to social distancing requirements. Office layouts must be restructured for adequate spacing between workspaces and to allow for routing that minimizes close-proximity encounters. Clear communication with staff will also be a key factor: Which areas should be avoided? When has an area last be cleaned?The ArcGIS Indoors system from Esri can help answer these geospatially focused questions for reopening the workplace. With indoor maps and an indoor positioning system, managers can create a floor-plan level awareness of the workplace, one that will allow for safe reopening._____________________Communities around the world are taking strides in mitigating the threat that COVID-19 (coronavirus) poses.

The sources of disease surveillance information include contact tracing, medical record review, and laboratory information, and are considered protected health information. When interpreting the results of these analyses, it is important to keep in mind that the disease surveillance system may not capture the full picture of the outbreak, and that previously reported data may change over time as it undergoes data quality review or as additional information is added. These analyses, especially within populations with small samples, may be subject to large amounts of variation from day to day.

,Park and Ride,"A combination of existing park and ride lots and candidate park and ride location in the state of Iowa, represented in a point feature.The Iowa Department of Transportation's park and ride system consists of state-owned park or permitted and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT's district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.In 2014, The Iowa Park and Ride System Plan was developed. This plan includes an update of the existing inventory, an identification of additional locations suitable for park and ride facilities, and strategies for implementation .The plan will be used by the Iowa DOT to plan, evaluate, and develop a formal state-owned-and-operated system of park and ride facilities. The primary objective of the plan is to provide a location-specific, priority-based park and ride system that allows for coordinated planning and implementation of park and ride facilities.As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan.Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",English,Iowa Department of Transportation,State of Iowa,Geospatial data,,Park and Ride|Ridesharing|Statewide|Iowa DOT|Assets|Inventory,2020-06-29T15:59:10.000Z,,,,Iowa,"-96.4674,40.7267,-90.5391,43.4322",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f19406b7d6a74256aadc6573b883f743_0,"http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f19406b7d6a74256aadc6573b883f743_0.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":3857,""wkid"":102100}",,https://services.arcgis.com/8lRhdTsQyJpO52F1/arcgis/rest/services/Park_and_Ride_View/FeatureServer/0,,f19406b7d6a74256aadc6573b883f743_0,,Iowa,03a-02,03a-02,active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,
