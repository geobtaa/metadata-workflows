Full limits of guardrail were inventoried along trunkline, including within medians and ramps. On Local Roads over / under trunkline, the inventory is limited to no more than 200 feet from the bridge railing end / from the pier or abutment, respectfully. Please see the?MDOT Metadata Form?for additional information.Update Cycle: The last statewide guardrail update was completed in 2006. Region-wide updates have occurred in both Southwest Region and University Region in 2015. Updates are added as they become available.Data Quality: This data set is in production and is accessed through desktop GIS, map services, and feature services. Data was collected by region using Trimble GEO XT and other similar units.Coverage: This inventory was collected to over 95% competition in 2006. Any assets added, removed, or changed since then may not be part of this inventory.Symbology: The preferred symbology for this asset in a map service is a line of width 3 and an RGB color of 0,92,230.Contact: Kevin McKnight,?mcknightk@michigan.gov",2017-02-14T14:20:45.000Z,2018-04-30T19:56:52.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0cf176e5d8c141a187430f5271d349d8_8,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT/mdot_assets/MapServer/8,"-90.2685,41.6473,-82.1361,47.495"
