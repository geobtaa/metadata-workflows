The first vector tile package was produced in November 2018. This basemap is a general reference set of data that includes information about transportation features (roads, railroads, airports and structures), as well as boundary information (state, county, and municipal boundaries), and surface water features (stream and lake information). The transportation features represent both the primary system as well as the local systems and rail features. The boundaries represent political jurisdictions as well as selected public interest lands. Surface waters include stream and lake locations.
