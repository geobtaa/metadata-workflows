Some of these opportunities have been capitalized upon?a number of significant trail segments already exist or are currently moving toward construction?but gaps still exist. In May 2012, DVRPC Board Member Terence Farrell and DVRPC Executive Director Barry Seymour joined Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter to celebrate the efforts of foundations, governments, non-profits, economic development professionals, and numerous other groups to fill these gaps and create an interconnected network of multi-use trails called The Circuit. This dataset reflects trail status and is a conceptual dataset - to be used at the regional-level only.?Connect the Circuit",2018-12-10T19:15:33.000Z,2019-01-04T14:26:55.128Z,http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/abb60a726cc5493cb59c6053bfcc53a0_0,https://services1.arcgis.com/LWtWv6q6BJyKidj8/arcgis/rest/services/DVRPC_Circuit_Trails/FeatureServer/0,"-75.98742430886503,39.61718134247433,-74.46736197707351,40.6069737288277",04f-01,Maryland,Regional & NGO Geospatial Data,{u'name': u'DVRPC-GIS'},"Delaware Valley, United States|Maryland, United States"
