Centers provide a focal point in the regional landscape that recognizes the regional and local significance of places, while reinforcing a sense of community for local residents. Centers serve as a basis for organizing and focusing the development landscape and provide a framework for the most efficient provision of supportive infrastructure systems, including water, sewer, and transportation. By concentrating growth around and within Centers, the region can both preserve open space and reduce infrastructure costs. The densities and mixed uses inherent within Centers can enhance the feasibility of walking, bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile. Connections 2040identifies a hierarchy of seven Center types, shown on the Planning Areas and Centers map, based on their role and activities within the region.METROPOLITAN CENTERCenter City/University City/Camden Central Business District ? spanning the Delaware River and bounded roughly by 40th Street from Girard to Washington avenues in Philadelphia and by the Ben Franklin Bridge and Interstate 676 to Clinton Street in Camden ? is identified as the region?s Metropolitan Center. This dense, compact, mixed-use area includes the central business districts of Philadelphia and Camden, major academic and medical institutions, and major tourist and entertainment destinations.METROPOLITAN SUBCENTERSThe Plan also identifies six Metropolitan Subcenters, reflecting their magnitude of jobs and commercial activity. These include the downtown area of Trenton and the destinations of King of Prussia/Valley Forge (Montgomery and Chester counties); International Airport (Delaware and Philadelphia counties), Navy Yard/Sports Complex (Philadelphia); Cherry Hill/Mount Laurel/Marlton (Burlington and Camden counties); and the Route 1 Corridor (Mercer County).NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERSConnections 2040recognizes that each of the region?s Core Cities is a collection of diverse neighborhoods with varying characteristics, assets, challenges, and needs, and that specific approaches and strategies for improving and revitalizing these neighborhoods will differ. The planning policies within the Core Cities and their neighborhoods focus on redevelopment and revitalization through targeted investment and reinvestment. Embedded within the region?s Core Cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester are Neighborhood Centers, which are recognizable places with a mix of commercial, retail, anchor institutional, and residential activities. Neighborhood Centers have an identifiable main street or focal point, are walkable, and have a unique history or sense of a community within the larger city setting. In addition to the metropolitan center, metropolitan subcenters, and neighborhood centers, the Plan identifies four other types of Centers: Suburban Centers, Town Centers, Rural Centers, and Planned Centers. The characteristics of each type are as follows:SUBURBAN CENTERSAre regionally significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are perceived as single ?places;? Are suburban in character; Are less dense than town centers; Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers; Are defined primarily by a concentration and variety of office, retail, professional, and light industrial uses, and generally have more jobs than residents; and are generally auto dependent rather than transit oriented or pedestrian scale.TOWN CENTERSHave a mixture of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than their surrounding land uses; Have a distinct downtown/main street area surrounded by relatively dense residential development; Are pedestrian friendly and often transit oriented; and Are surrounded by suburban land uses.RURAL CENTERSHave a minimum density of six people and three employees per developed acre; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area; Have a distinct downtown/main street (though smaller than a town center); and Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses. PLANNED CENTERSAre planned town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas or through redevelopment on greyfields and/or brownfields in Developed Communities; and Have plans that call for village-type development, incorporating mixed, integrated land uses, relatively high densities, and pedestrian connections.",,DVRPC|Connections 2045|Long-Range Plan|Planned Centers|Core Cities|Neighborhood Centers,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2020-06-02T19:49:41.000Z,,,"Delaware River, Delaware|Delaware|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Maryland|New Jersey","-75.9774,39.6853,-74.5237,40.4401",Maryland,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission,DVRPC-GIS,"http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cac499468a94411782a69a171aba8efd_0.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":26918,""wkid"":26918}",https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/portal/rest/services/Planning/LRP_2045_PlanCntrNeigh/FeatureServer/0,,

Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs. DVRPC currently assesses the following population groups, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau:YouthOlder AdultsFemaleRacial MinorityEthnic MinorityForeign-BornDisabledLimited English ProficiencyLow-IncomeCensus tables used to gather data from the 2014 -2018 American Community Survey 5-Year EstimatesUsing U.S. Census American Community Survey data, the population groups listed above are identified and located at the census tract level. Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.Census tables used to gather data from the 2014 - 2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.For more information and for methodology, visit DVRPC's website:?https://www.dvrpc.org/GetInvolved/TitleVI/Source of tract boundaries: US Census Bureau.

The original source data can accessed through a web map service or rest service.? Visit the?NWI Wetland Mapping Services Page?for more information.This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.

DC Health delineates statistical neighborhoods to facilitate small-area analyses and visualization of health, economic, social, and other indicators to display and uncover disparate outcomes among populations across the city. The neighborhoods are also used to determine eligibility for some health services programs and support research by various entities within and outside of government. DC Health Planning Neighborhood boundaries follow census tract lines defined by the US Census Bureau. Each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. This allows for easier comparison to Census data and calculation of rates per population (including estimates from the American Community Survey and Annual Population Estimates). These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations. There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset. Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries. Origin of boundaries: each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. They were originally determined in 2015 as part of an analytical research project with technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to define small area estimates of life expectancy. Census tracts were grouped roughly following the Office of Planning Neighborhood Cluster boundaries, where possible, and were made just large enough to achieve standard errors of less than 2 for each neighborhood's calculation of life expectancy. The resulting neighborhoods were used in the DC Health Equity Report (2018)with updated names. HPNs were modified slightly in 2019, incorporating one census tract that was consistently suppressed due to low numbers into a neighboring HPN (Lincoln Park incorporated into Capitol Hill).

the disease surveillance system may not capture the full picture of the outbreak, and that
previously reported data may change over time as it undergoes data quality review or as additional
information is added. These analyses, especially within populations with small samples, may be

de63a68eb7674548ae0ac01867123f7e_13,04c-01,DC Health Planning Neighborhoods,,"This dataset contains polygons that represent the boundaries of statistical neighborhoods as defined by the DC Department of Health (DC Health). DC Health delineates statistical neighborhoods to facilitate small-area analyses and visualization of health, economic, social, and other indicators to display and uncover disparate outcomes among populations across the city. The neighborhoods are also used to determine eligibility for some health services programs and support research by various entities within and outside of government. DC Health Planning Neighborhood boundaries follow census tract lines defined by the US Census Bureau. Each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. This allows for easier comparison to Census data and calculation of rates per population (including estimates from the American Community Survey and Annual Population Estimates). These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations. There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset. Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries. Origin of boundaries: each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. They were originally determined in 2015 as part of an analytical research project with technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to define small area estimates of life expectancy. Census tracts were grouped roughly following the Office of Planning Neighborhood Cluster boundaries, where possible, and were made just large enough to achieve standard errors of less than 2 for each neighborhood's calculation of life expectancy. The resulting neighborhoods were used in the DC Health Equity Report (2018) with updated names. HPNs were modified slightly in 2019, incorporating one census tract that was consistently suppressed due to low numbers into a neighboring HPN (Lincoln Park incorporated into Capitol Hill). Demographic information were analyzed to identify the bordering group with the most similarities to the single census tract.

50d820b1ccde4e58928bc5b8d77988ff_0,06f-01,Group Quarters,,"By using this data, you agree to the SEMCOG Copyright License Agreement. According to the Census Bureau, group quarters are places where people live or stay, in a group living arrangement, that is owned or managed by an entity providing housing and/or services for the residents. This is not a typical household-type living arrangement and the people living in group quarters are usually not related to one another. It is important to monitor the group quarters population because they are sampled as individuals within Census Bureau surveys, rather than as members of a household unit, and less information is reported.Group Quarters TypesInstitutional group quarters provide supervised custody or care to inmates or residents. This includes correctional facilities, assisted living, nursing homes, and memory care.Non-institutional group quarters house residents who are able or eligible to be in the labor force. This includes student and military housing, group homes, residential treatment centers, and religious housing.Group Quarters Facility CountsData on group quarters facilities is decentralized, and collected from a variety of federal and state agencies, educational institutions, industry associations, and private sources. At this time, only the maximum capacity or number of licensed beds is being reported. Moving forward it is our intention to collect current resident counts in addition to capacity numbers, however there is a time lag between the collection of these counts and the information being reported to the public, so spring 2020 resident counts will not be available until the year 2021.Group Quarters Facility AttributesSEMCOG maintains a limited number of attributes on the group quarters facility points data layer. Please note that because a single building may contain group quarters of different types, there will be cases where there is multiple records for a single structure. The metadata includes a list of the current attributes of the buildings dataset.  Group Quarters Classification CodeSEMCOG?s group quarters classification codes are adopted from the coding system established by the U.S. Census Bureau to classify group quarters in their data products. There are several Census codes not used by SEMCOG as our region does not contain those types of facilities, and one additional code added for a different type of facility. More information on Census group quarters codes, including full descriptions of each classification, can be found on the Census Bureau?s web site. SEMCOG classifies student housing differently than the Census, separating dorms from fraternities and sororities regardless of whether they are located on campus. In addition, student cooperative housing is added as an additional type due to the large number of such buildings in Ann Arbor. In addition, Census counts of homeless persons are distributed to government buildings in the largest community in each county and the City of Detroit to ensure their inclusion in the data layer.Definitions for the Group Quarters Classification Codes can be found in the metadata.

Tax map pages, which typically correspond to half quarter sections (in an east-west split), are modeled as a region subclass in the LANDFABRIC layer. If an indigenous people's reserve was present on the tax map, it was digitized to create subpolygons of the half-quarter section, and those polygons were attributed with the name of the reserve.

The hydrographic midline data layer is used to show the location of the midline of natural drainage features, and is connected to polygonal (standing) hydrographic features such as lakes and ponds. The midline data layer also includes drainage features less than five feet in width, which were not included in the polygon hydrography data set.? ? ? Midlines were added to water bodies such as double-line rivers to maintain the linear connectivity of the hydrographic network. Where the course of linear features (such as streams and rivers) in the hydrographic midline layer could not be compiled photogrammetrically due to being obscured by other features (such as vegetation or shadows), the obscured line segment was coded as ""interpreted"". In some cases, a flowing water feature may have run through an underground drain or culvert or its course otherwise obscured from view on the aerial photography. For such cases, in order to maintain linear connectivity of the features, its path was also interpreted and coded as such. Some hydrographic data was provided by the City of Chicago and incorporated into this data layer. These hydrographic data layers are modeled and stored as a network coverage containing polygons and/or lines.? ? ? This midline data layer was created out of need by Cook County to develop a hydrographic layer in which water features are represented as single lines. The intended primary use of this data layer is for small-scale mapping and networking.? ? ? The hydrographic midline layer was intersected with the street midline and railroad data layers to create nodes in the coverage model. It was also intersected with the bridge polygon data layer.
