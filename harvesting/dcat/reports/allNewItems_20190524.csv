c83e66c46c694ffb9b99bda1dc507ed0_3,04a-01,Maryland Water Quality - Tier II Catchments 2016,,"This dataset provides the Tier II catchments delineated for the most downstream Tier II segment. This file also provides the assimilative capacity (AC) status for each watershed. In cases where there is no remaining AC in a nested catchment but the larger encompassing segment has remaining AC, the smaller nested catchment is split out and assigned its own identification. These nested catchments are also then attributed to show the lack of AC remaining. The intended use of the catchment dataset is to assist State, Local, and Federal officials and stakeholders in determining the antidegradation status of current or planned activities which fall under the purview of the antidegradation policy and implementation procedure (COMAR 26.08.02.04-1).  Using GIS, the stakeholder can assess if any activity, proposed or operational, such as a discharge, is located on land which drains (has run off) directly into and can potentially adversely affect a Tier II stream segment.  This type of determination would be useful for permitting purposes, screening for sensitive or high quality resources, and various land use planning activities such as those undertaken by local officials during the Water Resources Element process, Water and Sewer Planning, or the Comprehensive Planning process.This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer.

The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (HARN), State Plane, Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Feet. Lidar data was delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 1,413 individual 4000 ft x 6000 ft tiles, as tiled Intensity Rasters, and as tiled bare-earth DEM; all tiled to the same 4000 ft x 6000 ft schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in early to mid 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. Sensor errors in mulitple locations were identified in processing, additonal acquisition on 7/20/2018 was completed to remedy the errors. 2016 lidar data was used with approval in a single area of restricted airspace. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Sanborn Map Company, Inc. established a total of 23 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area.

7304d999e92840f1a042499a449020eb,04a-01,Maryland LiDAR Carroll County - DEM Feet,,"MD/PA Sandy Supplemental Lidar Data Acquisition and Processing Production Task USGS Contract No. G10PC00057 Task Order No. G14PD00397 Woolpert Order No. 74333 CONTRACTOR: Woolpert, Inc. This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000.  Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP.

During the annual mosquito season in Washington DC, usually from April ? October, DC Healthdeploys surveillance and mitigation methods to control the mosquito population in the District. DC Health (also known as the D.C. Department of Health or formerly DOH) has been trapping and testing mosquitoes for West Nile virus (WNV) for well over a decade. Starting in 2016, and in response to the Zika outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, DC Health substantially increased mosquito monitoring activities across the city. There were a total of 28 sites and 36 traps across the 8 wards. Data was submitted to the Centers for Disease Control MoquitoNet Portal.Note: the 2017 analysis does not include data for October. This is because October of 2017 would have skewed the results far too much based on a few variables that occurred. For example, the number of traps which had failed by the end of the season.Mosquito species in Washington, D.C.:Culex Pipiens, Salinarius and Culex Restuan: spread West Nile VirusAedes aegypti : according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), health experts have determined this species to be the most competent vector, capable of transmitting Zika to the human population. To date, none of the Aedes aegypti trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus.Aedes albopictus: capable of spreading Zika to people. However, health experts are still learning whether it is likely to do so as it appears at this time, it is not as competent a vector for transmitting Zika as is the Aedes aegypti. Just because a mosquito can carry the virus does not mean that it will cause disease. So far, none of the Aedes albopictus trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus.Aedes japonicus: normally found in South Florida, is present in D.C. in small numbers.

26ccb25575484866b6e5a59fb489ad38_10,04c-01,Floodplains Outline,,"The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000. Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2015-02-27T20:55:39.000Z,,,Washington D.C,"-77.1198963112,38.7915818185,-76.9090164119,38.9959674382",Maryland,Municipalities Geospatial Data,District of Columbia,"City of Washington, DC",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/26ccb25575484866b6e5a59fb489ad38_10,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/26ccb25575484866b6e5a59fb489ad38_10.zip,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/10,,MapServer,Base Flood Elevation|COMMUNITY WASHINGTON|COUNTY DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA|COUNTYFIPS 11001|DFIRM|DFIRM Database|Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map|Elevation|Environment|FEMA Flood Hazard Zone|FEMACID 110001|FIRM|Flood Insurance Rate Map|Floodway|Hydrology|Inland Waters|NFIP|REGION 03|Riverine Flooding|SFHA|Special Flood Hazard Area|STATE DC|Structure|Transportation

The SLOSH Basin used for mapping was Chesapeake Bay (CP5), released in 2014.  This data was prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, Planning Division in January 2016.SLOSH storm tide elevations used for this mapping are based on the Maximum of Maximums (MOM) SLOSH output dataset. The MOM output elevations represent the highest calculated storm tide values based on thousands of SLOSH simulations using different combinations of approach direction, forward speed, landfall point, astronomical tide, and intensity (Category 1 through Category 4). Categories 1 through 4 refer to the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity.This map does not reflect the expected storm tide flooding for every hurricane, or for any one particular type of hurricane. This map shows the overall footprint of the area that has some risk of storm tide flooding from hurricanes, based on the MOM output dataset. The purpose of this data is to support hurricane emergency management planning activities.For more information on the SLOSH model and the MOM dataset, please visit http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/slosh.php.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2015-02-27T20:55:54.000Z,,,Washington D.C,"-77.1202141138,38.7856417144,-76.9354292399,38.9362208332",Maryland,Municipalities Geospatial Data,District of Columbia,"City of Washington, DC",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/a081c2756d844eb398de6ea4bf936ced_36,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/a081c2756d844eb398de6ea4bf936ced_36.zip,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/36,,MapServer,aug2016|DC GIS|District of Columbia|Environment|Environmental|Hurricane Evacuation Study|NCR GDX|Open Data|Storm Surge|Storm Surge Inundation|Washington DC

Dataset Description: The PEMA 2018 0.5-foot Orthoimagery - Crawford County Delivery project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of imagery data to be collected at a ground sample distance (GSD) of 0.5-foot (15 centimeters). Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Ortho Specification, Version 1.0. The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania North FIPS 3701, US Survey Feet. Orthoimagery data was delivered as 352 individual 0.5-foot (15-centimeter) 1 = 100' GeoTIFF (uncompressed) 10,000-foot x 10,000-foot (3,048-meter x 3,048-meter) tiles. Ground Conditions: Aerial photography was captured during the spring of 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the imagery data to meet task order specifications and meet horizontal accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 496 QC points throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to assess the horizontal accuracy of the data.

Large municipalities with a separate storm sewer system serving a population greater than 250,000 and medium municipalities with a service population between 100,000 and 250,000 had to obtain NPDES permits. Initial application deadlines for large and medium municipalities were November 16, 1992 and May 17, 1993, respectively. As part of their individual NPDES permit applications, the large and medium MS4s had to develop a storm water management program (SWMP).

The Phase II regulations address storm water runoff of MS4s serving populations less than 100,000, called small MS4s. More particularly, small MS4s located partially or fully within urbanized areas (UAs), as determined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and also on a case-by-case basis for those small MS4s located outside of UAs that Ohio EPA designates into the program. Automatically designated Small MS4s, those in UAs, were required to apply for permit coverage and develop and submit a SWMP by March 10, 2003.Ohio considers the Urban Areas defined under the 2000 and 2010 Census, as well as more than 30 cities located outside of the the urban areas that are also covered by a storm water permit, as a Regulated MS4 Area.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2019-03-28T18:24:25.000Z,,,"Ohio, United States","-84.8202,38.4032,-80.5187,41.9117",Ohio State,State Agencies Geospatial Data,State of Ohio,Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/faae32ac959346bbace7cf6fea0c3319_10,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/faae32ac959346bbace7cf6fea0c3319_10.zip,https://epagistest2.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WM/DSW/MapServer/10,,MapServer,MS4|storm water|stormwater|urban|permitted activities|DSW|surface water|land use
