,2018 Impaired Lakes of Iowa,"This dataset represents the centroids of lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands that were listed as ""impaired"" in Iowa's 2018 Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment and the 303(d) Impaired Waters Report. Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2018 Integrated Report. Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"". New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions.

,2018 Impaired Streams of Iowa,"This dataset contains line work that representing streams and rivers listed as ""impaired"" in Iowa's 2018 Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment and the 303(d) Impaired Waters Report. Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2018 Integrated Report. Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"". New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL"").

,Threatened and Endangered Species Ranges,"This data is showing the current ranges in Nebraska for the species listed as threatened or endangered in the state. This version supersedes all previously dated versions. Updates are made to the shapefile as new information becomes available, and periodically updated maps are posted to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission website. A range map is a generalized representation of the distribution of a species. A species might occur anywhere within a mapped range in which there is suitable habitat. These maps show current ranges rather than historical ranges. Thus an area in which a given species formerly occurred is not included if there is a high degree of confidence on the part of NGPC biologists that the species no longer occurs there. Species, particularly those highly mobile such as birds, may occur outside of their range in locations in which the species is generally described as 'accidental' or 'vagrant.' Range maps do not include such locations. Species may also occur outside the range if the range has changed since the time it was last updated.",English,State of Nebraska,State of Nebraska,Geospatial data,,Biota|Nebraska|SpeciesRanges|At-Risk|NGPC,2020-12-01T17:54:25.000Z,,,,Nebraska,"-104.2273,39.8910,-95.0993,43.1123",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/376431599c89409793770794e380a2fd_0,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/376431599c89409793770794e380a2fd_0.zip,,https://gis.ne.gov/Enterprise/rest/services/E_TSpeciesRanges/FeatureServer/0,,376431599c89409793770794e380a2fd_0,Nebraska,13a-01,13a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE
