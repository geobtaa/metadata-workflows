,Condominium Points,"SEMCOG maintains three separate data layers that represent information on built structures in Southeast Michigan: building footprints, building points, and condominium points. The Building Footprints were the first dataset collected. These were originally developed by using heads-up digitizing to trace the outlines of buildings in 2010 aerial photography. This process was repeated later using 2015 and 2019 imagery. Due to differences in spatial accuracy between the 2010 and later imagery sources, footprint polygons delineated using 2010 aerial photography may appear slightly shifted compared with imagery that is more recent. This dataset is current as of April 2019, and contains only three attributes: the unique building identifier, median height and the source of the footprint polygon. The Building Points dataset is a point layer representing a single point, at the center of the structure, for each building in Southeast Michigan as of April 2020. For buildings with an associated footprint polygon, the building point represents the centroid of the polygon. For newer structures, a point is placed at the approximate center of the structure as shown in recent imagery, as no footprint polygon yet exists. Since it is the building points that represent our most current universe of buildings in the region, this is the dataset on which we store the associated attributes of a building, mainly location and physical characteristics obtained from local assessing data and other sources. The Condominium Points dataset is also a point layer, with each point representing an attached condominium unit located within a building. Unlike site condominiums, attached condominiums are by definition only a portion of a single building, but as each unit can be individually owned they need to be tracked independently. To ensure an accurate match between condominium points and the building in which they are located, the condominium points are placed on the building centroid, and do not represent the actual physical location of the unit.Building AttributesAs stated above, SEMCOG maintains building attributes on the building points data layer. The condominium points and building footprints data layers have only a small subset of these attributes.

Square footage evenly divisible by 100 is an estimate, based on size and/or type of building, if the true value is unknown. Building TypesSEMCOG's building types are based on the 2017 North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). This system classifies establishments based on economic activity, is widely accepted by the planning community, and used by SEMCOG in developing its long-range socioeconomic forecasts. Each of the 22 nonresidential building types represent one or more entire 3-digit NAICS sector groupings, except for five special types of building that do not fit within this system. These specific types of activity (movie theaters, libraries, dormitories, funeral services, and parking garages) have land use and trip generation characteristics that are different from the other types of activity in their respective NAICS sector and are therefore classified individually. More information on NAICS, including descriptions of the economic activity sectors, can be found at the Census Bureau's NAICS web site. There are also four residential building types, which assist us in tracking housing development over time. Residential types are based on a combination of units in structure, and ownership. Single-family homes and site condominiums typically contain only one unit, but there are traditional duplexes where one owner owns both units, that are also classified as single-family. Attached condo buildings contain two or more housing units in a single building, each of which shares one or more walls with an adjoining unit and can be independently owned. Multi-family housing or apartment buildings contain three or more units, all of which are owned by a single entity and intended as rental units. Figure B.1Distribution of Buildings by Type As seen in Figure B.1, 86.9 percent of all buildings are single-family homes, and only 5.8 percent of buildings are of any nonresidential building type.Mobile homes are a special building type, as we do not receive information on changes to mobile homes in a manufactured housing park through the building permits pipeline. We instead maintain a separate layer of points representing individual mobile homes in parks, updated periodically using imagery to denote if a trailer is still present at each point. Pseudo footprints for these points are generated via code and added to the buildings manually.There are structures that SEMCOG does not classify as buildings. To be considered a building, a structure must contain either a housing unit or a minimum of 250 square feet of nonresidential workspace. Therefore, garages, boathouses, and other accessory structures are not classified as buildings. A description of SEMCOG building types, including the relevant NAICS codes for the type, can be found in Table B.2:Table B.2Building Types by NAICS SectorBUILD TYPEDESCRIPTIONNAICS SECTORSRGB11Educational611190-232-25513Religious and Civic8130-132-16814Governmental921-9280-76-11521Retail Building441-454, 811-812255-190-19023Office Building511-551, 561255-0-031Manufacturing311-339194-158-21532Wholesale Trade423-425170-102-20533Warehouse and Storage493112-68-13741Transportation and Utility221, 481-488, 562204-204-20442Delivery Services491-492156-156-15651Health and Social Services621, 624214-157-18852Hospital622245-122-18253Residential Care Facility623137-68-10161Leisure Activity711-713137-205-10263Hotel and Motel721209-255-11565Eating and Drinking72285-255-071Agricultural111-213255-255-081Single-Family HousingResidential255-211-12782Attached Condo BuildingResidential230-152-083Multi-Family ApartmentResidential137-112-6884Mobile HomeResidential137-68-6891Movie Theater51213168-0-092Library519120-197-25593Dormitory Quarters7213192-137-6894Funeral Services81220255-127-12795Parking Garage8129378-78-78The RGB color values match SEMCOG's typical map symbology for building types.Relationship between Buildings LayersCounty land parcel layers are used to assign the unique APN (Assessor Parcel Number), as well as parcel identifier, to each structure located on a parcel by means of spatial intersection between the parcels and buildings layers. However, there are counties which do not represent parcel splits in their parcel layer when large vacant parcels are developed into single-family subdivisions. In these cases, the polygon geometry of the original parent parcel is cloned once for each new child parcel. A geospatial intersection of buildings to parcels in this situation would lead to each building in the subdivision being assigned to whichever parcel polygon happened to be sitting on top of the stack of cloned parcels. In these cases we use other sources, such as building permits and developer site plans, to identify the APN of each new building, and then assign the parcel identifier by finding the land parcel with that APN. Figure B.2Primary Key Relationship of Buildings LayersLand ParcelsBuilding FootprintsBuilding PointsCondominium Pointsparcel_id (unique) ----->parcel_id --------------->parcel_id --------------->parcel_idbuilding_id (unique) --->building_id (unique) --->building_idAPN (unique) ---------->APN -------------------->APN -------------------->APN (unique)condo_id (unique)The APN and parcel identifier are passed to each building on a parcel, with each building assigned a unique building identifier. Since building points are the centroid of building footprints, they share the same building identifier as they reference the same structure. Condominium records are assigned a unique condo identifier, and also the building identifier of the structure they are located within. By this process, each layer has a unique identifier, and can be related to the larger parent geography as needed.Last Update: 01/05/2021",English,Southeast Michigan Council of Governments,State of Michigan,Geospatial data,,Condominiums|BuildingFootprints|Buildings|Condos,2020-06-24T15:39:49.000Z,,,,Michigan,"-84.0775,41.7181,-82.4174,43.1329",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0.zip,,https://services1.arcgis.com/xUx8EjNc6egUPYWh/arcgis/rest/services/land_gisview_terra_condos_2020/FeatureServer/0,,a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,Michigan State University,06a-01,06a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Hosted Feature Layer for accessing the MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data product.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for roadways throughout the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerline data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway-related data products.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2019.Last Updated: July 2020 (07/22/20)For more information about each attribute field, please review theMDOT SHA Roadway Centerline -Data DictionaryFor more information, contact MDOT SHA OIT Enterprise Information Services:Email:GIS@mdot.maryland.gov",English,Maryland SHA,State of Maryland,Geospatial data,,Centerline|Centerlines|RouteCenterline|CenterlineRoutes|RoadCenterline|RoadwayCenterline|MarylandDepartmentofTransportation|MDOT|MarylandDepartmentofTransportationStateHighwayAdministration|MDOTSHA|OfficeoPlanning&PreliminaryEngineering|OPPE|DataServicesDivision|DSD|MDOTSHAOITEnterpriseInformationServices|2019,2020-08-08T00:26:50.000Z,,,,Maryland,"-79.4862,37.9294,-75.0011,39.7331",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0.zip,,https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT_SHA_Roadway_Centerline/FeatureServer/0,,2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,University of Maryland,04a-01,04a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

This is analogous to the removal of mass points for the same reason in a traditional photogrammetrically compiled DTM. This process was done in batch using proprietary software. The technicians then used proprietary software for the production of the lidar-derived hydro-flattened bare earth DEM surface in initial grid format at 1 m GSD. Water bodies (inland ponds and lakes), inland streams and rivers, and island holes were hydro-flattened within the DEM. Once the initial, hydro-flattened bare earth DEM was generated, the tiles were checked to ensure that the grid spacing met specifications. The surface was also checked to ensure proper hydro-flattening.",English,"City of Washington, DC","Washington, District of Columbia",Aerial imagery,,DC|ImageService|Raster|LiDAR|2018|DTM|DigitalTerrianModel,2019-11-06T14:58:06.000Z,,,,"Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia|Maryland|Virginia","-77.1220,38.7855,-76.9007,39.0017",Image|Service,Image,Imagery,https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/288c927005c84e768a57b0212c2700a6,,,,https://imagery.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/Lidar/Hydro_Enforced_DTM_2018/ImageServer,288c927005c84e768a57b0212c2700a6,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/288c927005c84e768a57b0212c2700a6,University of Maryland,04c-01,04c-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December.

,Threatened and Endangered Species Ranges,"This data is showing the current ranges in Nebraska for the species listed as threatened or endangered in the state. This version supersedes all previously dated versions. Updates are made to the shapefile as new information becomes available, and periodically updated maps are posted to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission website. A range map is a generalized representation of the distribution of a species. A species might occur anywhere within a mapped range in which there is suitable habitat. These maps show current ranges rather than historical ranges. Thus an area in which a given species formerly occurred is not included if there is a high degree of confidence on the part of NGPC biologists that the species no longer occurs there. Species, particularly those highly mobile such as birds, may occur outside of their range in locations in which the species is generally described as 'accidental' or 'vagrant.' Range maps do not include such locations. Species may also occur outside the range if the range has changed since the time it was last updated.",English,State of Nebraska,State of Nebraska,Geospatial data,,Biota|Nebraska|SpeciesRanges|At-Risk,2020-12-31T17:44:00.000Z,,,,Nebraska,"-104.2273,39.8910,-95.0993,43.1123",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0.zip,,https://gis.ne.gov/Enterprise/rest/services/E_TSpeciesRanges/FeatureServer/0,,dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,13a-01,13a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Bike LTS,"Centerline file used for Bike LTS Network. Has existing streets and bike paths integrated.Clean topology. All connections are end point to end point.Bridges involving bike paths cleaned manually to accommodate bug in Network Analyst connectivity using elevation fields.The Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) system rates or scores streets and paths by calculating an LTS score (1, 2, 3, or 4) for each street or multi-use path segment, intersection approach, and intersection crossing and then assigning the highest of the three scores to the segment. In those cases where the intersection LTS score is higher than the street segment score, the street segment encompassing the first block on either side of the intersection is given the higher intersection score. LTS scores for street segments are based on the posted speed limit, traffic volumes (for streets without bike facilities), number of travel lanes, and bicycle lane or bicycle/parking lane dimensions. Multi-use paths are classified as the lowest stress (LTS score of 1). Description of LTS Levels for Street SegmentsLTS 1: Paths and streets with 1 lane per direction, speed limits ≤ 25 mph, and low traffic volumes or bike lanes.LTS 2: Streets with 1-2 lanes per direction, speed limits ≤ 30 mph, and low traffic volumes or bike lanes.LTS 3: Streets with 1-2 lanes per direction, speed limits ≤ 35 mph, and moderate traffic volumes or bike lanes.LTS 4: Streets with 2-3 lanes per direction, speed limits ≤ 40, and high traffic volumes.The LTS score for an intersection approach is based on the intersection configuration. Specifically, the score is based on whether there is a right-turn only lane and, if so, whether there is a ""pocket"" bike lane to the left of the right-turn lane and other details related to the design of these lanes and the curb radius of the intersection. Description of LTS levels for Intersection ApproachesLTS 1: Simple intersection with no right-turn lane(s) and slow turning speeds.LTS 2: Intersection with single right-turn lane and bike lane that continues straight.LTS 3: Intersection with somewhat longer right-turn lane and no bike lane or one in which the bike lane shifts to the left across the right-turn lane.LTS 4: Other intersection configurations with right-turn lane(s) and higher turning speeds.The LTS score for an unsignalized intersection crossing is based on the number of travel lanes per direction on the intersecting street to be crossed, the presence of a median (for multi-lane streets), and the speed limit on the intersecting street. Description of LTS Levels for Intersection CrossingsUnsignalized CrossingsLTS 1: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit ≤ 30 mph or 2 lanes but speed limit ≤ 25 mph.LTS 2: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit ≤ 35 mph or 2 lanes but speed limit ≤ 30 mph.LTS 3: Intersecting street has speed limit of 40+ mph or 2 lanes per direction and speed limit of 35 mph.LTS 4: Intersecting street has 2+ lanes per travel direction and 40+ mph speed limit.Signalized CrossingsCrossing streets at signalized intersections does not present a significant barrier for bicyclists and thus does not affect the LTS score of the street and intersection approach.",English,City of Madison Map Data,"City of Madison, Wisconsin",Geospatial data,,Transportation|CityofMadison|MPO|DaneCounty|Wisconsin|MetroTransit|GreaterMadisonMPO|Bike|Bicyclists,2021-01-11T16:27:08.000Z,,,,City of Madison,"-89.8409,42.8443,-89.0065,43.2934",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c203c656c7b3465cb68118918c09f7a4_56,https://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c203c656c7b3465cb68118918c09f7a4_56.zip,https://maps.cityofmadison.com/arcgis/rest/services/Public/OPEN_DATA_TRANS/MapServer/56,,,c203c656c7b3465cb68118918c09f7a4_56,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/c203c656c7b3465cb68118918c09f7a4_56,University of Wisconsin-Madison,10c-03,10c-03,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

The color files cover all of Kenosha, Ozaukee, Racine, Walworth, and Washington Counties, a large portion of Milwaukee County, and small portions of Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Rock, and Sheboygan Counties in Southeastern Wisconsin. The color orthophoto files were compiled at one-inch-equals-200-feet (1"" = 200') scale with a pixel resolution of twelve inches (12""). The color orthophoto files covering the northern townships of Milwaukee County (T8N-R21E and T8N-R22E) have a pixel resolution of six inches (6""). The image files are available in GeoTIFF or MrSID format. Each color GeoTIFF format file covers an area of 5,000 by 5,000 feet on the Wisconsin State Plane Coordinate System, South Zone, with zero overlap between images. There are a total of 2,514 GeoTIFF files in the data set with accompanying ""world"" ("".tfw"") files. The MrSID format files were prepared from mosaics of the GeoTIFF format files. Each color MrSID format file covers an area of one U.S. Public Land Survey System (USPLSS) township. The 59 MrSID format files contain imagery beyond the boundaries of the survey township and do overlap. The MrSID files have accompanying ""world"" ("".sdw"") files. The black-and-white orthophoto files cover all of the aforementioned area and also cover all of Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties.

,Easements,"Easements are limitations on the rights and use of the land. Legally an encumbrance is a right or interest in the land of another that may diminish its value but does not prevent its sale. Most encumbrances run with the land (consistent with the passing of the fee by conveyance). That is, they are tied to the land and will persist from owner to owner. Others exist at the pleasure of the owner, such as leases. Typically leases and similar encumbrances have an effective date and expiration date. As a practice Sauk County did not capture all easements due to software space limitations and clutter on the maps. It was the sole discretion of the Real Property Lister to decide which easements would be captured. In 2015 Sauk County decided to capture all easements going forward. There are some easements after 2015 that do not have a complete description to physically draw the Easement, so in those cases an Easement Anno is captured noting the document number recorded at the county.",English,Sauk County Land Information\GIS,"Sauk County, Wisconsin",Geospatial data,,Easement|Encumbrance|housing,2016-07-22T21:22:09.000Z,,,,Sauk County,"-90.3088,43.1609,-89.5993,43.6421",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://data-saukgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4240b3ecd42a45f0bb45a5472a136589_0,https://data-saukgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4240b3ecd42a45f0bb45a5472a136589_0.zip,https://gis.co.sauk.wi.us/arcgis/rest/services/Sauk/Easements/MapServer/0,,,4240b3ecd42a45f0bb45a5472a136589_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/4240b3ecd42a45f0bb45a5472a136589_0,University of Wisconsin-Madison,10b-55111,10b-55111,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management.

,Parent Material (Township),"This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. Soils 1. Description Soil polygons identified by soil mapping unit ID. 2. Data Source U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 3. Date of Mapping 1971 (Rectified to Aerial Photography in Year 2000) 4. Mapping Scale 1:15,840 (1""=1,320') 5.

In order to avoid duplication of features from three soil types (Pm, RkE & RlA), the erase function was used from ArcToolbox. By erasing the Depth to Bedrock from the the <1 Foot to Water Table, the result of that process erased from the <3 Feet to Water Table and finally that result erased from the Percent Slope, a heirarchy was established. In order of priority: <1 Foot to Water Table, <3 Feet to Water Table, Shallow Bedrock and Slopes >12%. Depth to Seasonal High Water Table 1.

,LiDAR Breaklines,"Ayres Associates provided Wood County, Wisconsin, with lidar based topographic mapping services in the spring of 2015 as part of WROC. The LiDAR data was collected from 3/21/2015 to3/31/2015using an Optech Orion H300 sensor mounted in a fixed-wing aircraft. LiDAR data was collected to support the generation of 2-foot contours to meet FEMA vertical accuracy standards. The LiDAR data was delivered according to a 5,000 foot x 5,000 foot tile schematic. The LiDAR data was calibrated using information collected at the time of flight from GPS base stations on the ground and airborne GPS/IMU in the aircraft. The calibrated LiDAR data was processed to produce a classified point cloud, bare earth DTM, DEM, DSM, contours, breaklines, and intensity images.Hydrographic breaklines are collected using LiDARgrammetry to ensure hydroflattened water surfaces. This process involves manipulating the LiDAR data's intensity information to create a metrically sound stereo environment. From this generated ""imagery"", breaklines are photogrammetrically compiled. Breakline polygons are created to represent open water bodies. The LiDAR points that fall within these areas are classified as ""water."" Breaklines representing streams and rivers shall be smooth, continuous, and monotonic, and represent the water surface without any stair steps except for dams and rapids. All hydrographic breaklines include a 1 foot buffer, with the points being re-classified as Class 10 (ignored ground). TerraSolid is further used for the subsequent manual classification of the LiDAR points allowing technicians to view the point cloud in a number of ways to ensure accuracy and consistency of points and uniformity of point coverage.
