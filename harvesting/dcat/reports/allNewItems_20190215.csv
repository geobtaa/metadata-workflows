536687a3a8f74152b8140a4a7464a2c6_0,03a-02,Park and Ride Location,,"The Iowa Department of Transportation?s park and ride system consists of state-owned park or permitted and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT?s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.?In 2014, The Iowa Park and Ride System Plan was developed. This plan includes an update of the existing inventory, an identification of additional locations suitable for park and ride facilities, and strategies for implementation .The plan will be used by the Iowa DOT to plan, evaluate, and develop a formal state-owned-and-operated system of park and ride facilities. The primary objective of the plan is to provide a location-specific, priority-based park and ride system that allows for coordinated planning and implementation of park and ride facilities.As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system.? This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan.?Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the? Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.?",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2019-01-07T19:11:52.000Z,,,"Iowa, United States","-96.94699999999837,40.25899999999931,-89.98099999999849,43.75099999999925",Iowa,State Agencies Geospatial Data,State of Iowa,Iowa Department of Transportation,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/536687a3a8f74152b8140a4a7464a2c6_0,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/536687a3a8f74152b8140a4a7464a2c6_0.zip,https://services.arcgis.com/8lRhdTsQyJpO52F1/arcgis/rest/services/Park_and_Ride_View/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Park and Ride|Ridesharing|Statewide|Iowa DOT|Assets|Inventory|Asset Inventory

The Numbering Plan Areas reflect current and accurate boundary changes both where new NPAs split from existing NPAs and where new NPAs overlay existing NPAs. When an NPA is split, the geographic area covered by the old area code is divided geographically, with one portion retaining the previous area code and the other switching to the new area code. When a new NPA is added as an overlay, the old area code remains unaffected.

staff to submit a final draft of Minneapolis 2040 to the Metropolitan Council
for their review. It is expected that the Metropolitan Council will complete
their review in the first half of 2019, with the Minneapolis City Council
taking final action on the Plan shortly thereafter. The guidance described in
this layer will likely change as part of that review and final action, and this
layer will subsequently be updated accordingly. The future land use and built
form maps of Minneapolis 2040 are not yet adopted City policy, but this data
that informs those maps has been provided here for ease of access related to
various requests for this information.

Goods and Services Corridors serve two purposes within the
Minneapolis 2040 Future Land Use Map. They indicate where commercial uses
should front in relation to properties guided for commercial future land uses. They
also identify where the establishment or expansion of commercial uses can be
considered. Properties immediately adjacent to a Goods and Services Corridor
may be considered for commercial activity, allowing for uses similar in scale
and scope to the Neighborhood and Corridor Mixed Use categories.Fields:

staff to submit a final draft of Minneapolis 2040 to the Metropolitan Council
for their review. It is expected that the Metropolitan Council will complete
their review in the first half of 2019, with the Minneapolis City Council
taking final action on the Plan shortly thereafter. The guidance described in
this layer will likely change as part of that review and final action, and this
layer will subsequently be updated accordingly. The future land use and built
form maps of Minneapolis 2040 are not yet adopted City policy, but this data
that informs those maps has been provided here for ease of access related to various
requests for this information.

The Future Land Use and Built Form Maps are the primary tools
for implementing the Land Use and Built Form policies of the Comprehensive
Plan. They also embody and implement policies found throughout Minneapolis
2040, as well as the fourteen Comprehensive Plan Goals. The Future Land Use Map
guides land use for every parcel in the city. Any changes to the use of land
must be consistent with the guidance of the Future Land Use Map. The Built Form
Map guides the scale of development for every parcel in the city through Built
Form Districts. The built form of all new and remodeled buildings must be
consistent with the guidance of the Built Form Map. This layer contains parcel
level data regarding Future Land Use and Built Form guidance from Minneapolis

45026acc949e41e5ae2130e7218be6fb_2,06a-01,Trout and Salmon Inland Stream Regulation Types (Layer 4 of 4) - BTRA Lines,,"Features from the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) were used to depict inland stream trout and salmon Brook Trout Restoration Area (lines) type regulations for 2018-2019. NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200 and FO 210. Except for streams in the Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters, any other inland stream not classified by type (1-4; GR, RA, BTRA, 10BKT) are still subject to trout and salmon fishing regulations as described on page 40 of the Michigan Fishing Guide. Please see pp. 24-25 for Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters regulations. Note that the 4 inland stream trout and salmon regulation type GIS layers only show the streams classified by type; these layers do not include any streams that are not classified by type. The regulation type associated with a stream feature is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated). Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types. Regulation types are as follows: 1 - Type 1 Trout Stream; 2 - Type 2 Trout Stream; 3 - Type 3 Trout Stream; 4 - Type 4 Trout Stream; 10BKT - 10 Brook Trout Stream; BTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration Area; RA - Research Area Trout Stream; GR - Gear Restricted Stream. Designation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, 10BKT, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. The main layer shows the majority of inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations. However, streams with multiple types will have additional features in the BTRA lines, BTRA polygon or the dual regulation layers. To show all inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations, all four layers must be displayed in the proper order using established symbology. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA polygon, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom. When displaying with inland trout and salmon lakes Types A-F, all four of the stream layers should be displayed underneath the Types A-F layer. For the main regulation type layer, set the drawing order so that specific regulations type display on top of others. Do this by going to Properties  Symbology  Advanced  Symbol levels and using the following order, from top to bottom: GR, RA, 4_0, 4_1, 3_0, 3_1, 2_1, 10BKT, 1_1.

175a98eeffa44bc1937005a87300df0a,12b-17097,Contours - Township 44N Range 10E (dgn),,"These data comprise of one foot contours showing the elevation of Lake County, IL corresponding to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover). These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download. Please note that this dataset is available in for GIS in Esri shapefile format as well as for CAD in AutoCAD DWG and MicroStation DGN.

7b30f42898e54ea8afb57df9b08dfbc3,12b-17097,Contours - Township 46N Range 11E (dwg),,"These data comprise of one foot contours showing the elevation of Lake County, IL corresponding to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover). These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.

f5102e101e7c4ca6afd7ac02e86d2c51,12b-17097,Contours - Township 45N Range 9E (dwg),,"These data comprise of one foot contours showing the elevation of Lake County, IL corresponding to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover). These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download. Please note that this dataset is available in for GIS in Esri shapefile format as well as for CAD in AutoCAD DWG and MicroStation DGN.

and ponds) of Lake County, Illinois. The features captured in this 
polygon dataset include: lakes, ponds, detention/retention basins, 
river/streams/creeks greater than five feet wide, and islands.

        The data has not been field verified and errors and/or omissions may be present.

        The names used for the water bodies were collected from a 
number of sources including: existing datasets, historic maps and/or 
atlases, US Geologic Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS),
 current and historical USGS topographic quadrangle maps, local 
publications on place names within the county, and platted subdivisions.

        The dataset was traced from aerial photography captured 
between April 13 and April 26, 2002. The water features were compiled 
using softcopy analytical stereoplotters. This dataset should meet 
National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product and it is 
georeferenced to the Illinois State Plane, Eastern Zone, using the NAD83

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.

1f3f35b1e1f74c788e9be753eb53efff,12b-17097,1939 Lake County Aerial - SE Quarter,,"This two foot pixel resolution black and white aerial photography was flown on various dates in July and August 1939. They were scanned in 2001, and georeferenced in 2002. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from paper prints, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as pen marks and fading. Caution should be used in interpreting features in this photography with reference to current conditions. In particular, many roads and road intersections have been realigned in the more than 60 years since this photography was taken. This historic aerial photography was captured in digital form as the result of a cooperative project between the Illinois State Geological Survey and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mapping Division of the Lake County Department of Information Technology. It is part of a statewide program to preserve the oldest known extensive aerial photography for future generations. The original photography was performed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of a nation-wide program for use in agricultural assessment. Since the original negatives became unstable and were destroyed by the National Archives in the 1980's, only paper prints remain. A set of paper prints representing the best available quality was assembled from the collections of several agencies.",error,,error,error,,2018-02-01T19:57:01.000Z,,,"Lake County, Illinois, United States|Illinois, United States","-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",Chicago,Counties Geospatial Data,"Lake County, Illinois","Lake County, Illinois",http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1f3f35b1e1f74c788e9be753eb53efff,error,https://s3.amazonaws.com/lakecountygis-public/aerials/LakeCounty1939AerialsSE.zip,,,Orthophotography|Orthophoto|Orthoimagery|Digital orthophoto|Digital orthorectified imagery|Digital orthoimagery|High resolution orthoimagery|Imagery|Aerial photography|Satellite imagery|Air imagery|Historic aerial imagery|Color aerial imagery|Air Photo|2002

716b7c6619114866b00ed2efbf80ddde,12b-17097,Contours - Township 44N Range 9E (dwg),,"These data comprise of one foot contours showing the elevation of Lake County, IL corresponding to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover). These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download. Please note that this dataset is available in for GIS in Esri shapefile format as well as for CAD in AutoCAD DWG and MicroStation DGN.
