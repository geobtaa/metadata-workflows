,Steep Slopes,"Clickhereto download as shapefile.Steep slopes for Anne Arundel County, MD. This dataset was created using ESRI's ArcGIS 10.3 with the Spatial Analyst extension. The source data was the County's 2011 Digital Elevation Model with a 3 foot resolution. The ""Slope"" command was used against the DEM to create a raster dataset with slope classifications based on the County Code (15 - 24.99%, 25% and greater). The raster dataset was then converted to a vector dataset by using the ""Extract by Attribute"" raster tool for both ""15 to 25%"" and ""25% and greater"". These two datasets were then merged together.

NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within a year of acquisition. This is one of NAIP's two main products: 1-meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQS) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP). The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75'x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 360-meter buffer on all four sides. ,eng,"Anne Arundel County, MD","Anne Arundel County, Maryland",Imagery,,OrthoNAIP2007|Imagery|AnneArundelCounty|AACO|OpenData,2020-01-10T15:23:34.000Z,,,"Herald Harbor, Maryland|Deale, Maryland|Kettering, Maryland|Brooklyn Park, Maryland|Ferndale, Maryland|Talbot County, Maryland|Annapolis, Maryland|North Beach, Maryland|Woodmore, Maryland|North Laurel, Maryland|Largo, Maryland|Springdale, Maryland|Shady Side, Maryland|Baltimore Highlands, Maryland|Rosaryville, Maryland|Queen Anne's County, Maryland|Mayo, Maryland|Lake Arbor, Maryland|Jessup, Maryland|Gambrills, Maryland|Seabrook, Maryland|Edgewater, Maryland|Calvert County, Maryland|Galesville, Maryland|Naval Academy, Maryland|Queensland, Maryland|Queen Anne, Maryland|Howard County, Maryland|Marlboro Village, Maryland|Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Croom, Maryland|Highland Beach, Maryland|Fairwood, Maryland|Crofton, Maryland|Crownsville, Maryland|Brown Station, Maryland|Lake Shore, Maryland|Pasadena, Maryland|Caroline County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Friendship, Maryland|Glenarden, Maryland|Westphalia, Maryland|Savage, Maryland|Linthicum, Maryland|Owings, Maryland|Riva, Maryland|Marlton, Maryland|Brock Hall, Maryland|Severn, Maryland|Prince George's County, Maryland|Cape St. Claire, Maryland|Severna Park, Maryland|Riviera Beach, Maryland|Maryland City, Maryland|Glenn Dale, Maryland|Mitchellville, Maryland|Annapolis Neck, Maryland|Arnold, Maryland|Odenton, Maryland|Bowie, Maryland|Arden On The Severn, Maryland|Lanham, Maryland|Elkridge, Maryland|Fort Meade, Maryland|Baltimore County, Maryland|Glen Burnie, Maryland|Parole, Maryland|Melwood, Maryland|Dunkirk, Maryland|Marlboro Meadows, Maryland|Maryland","-76.8810,38.6842,-76.3662,39.2532",Satellite imagery,Imagery,https://opendata.aacounty.org/datasets/bce7073294ce4a71a52d22606b40ea6e,,,,https://gis.aacounty.org/image/rest/services/Ortho/NAIP_2007/ImageServer,bce7073294ce4a71a52d22606b40ea6e,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/bce7073294ce4a71a52d22606b40ea6e,University of Maryland,04b-24003,04b-24003,Active,ArcGIS Hub,2021-12-05,,Public,False,False,0.0022 MB

,Zip Codes,"This layer was modified from ESRI's zip code layer for Anne Arundel County's CAD system. The modifications include extending the boudary to include centerlines and address points beyond the typical boundary (piers & bridges). In addition, the PO_NAME field is populated with the CAD city code name rather than the true USPS name (ex. Annapolis, rather than Eastport). Other modifications and corrections have occured based on information from the USPS website (http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp). U.S. ZIP Code Areas (Five-Digit) represents five-digit ZIP Code areas used by the U.S. Postal Service to deliver mail more effectively. The first digit of a five-digit ZIP Code divides the United States into 10 large groups of states numbered from 0 in the Northeast to 9 in the far West. Within these areas, each state is divided into an average of 10 smaller geographical areas, identified by the second and third digits. These digits, in conjunction with the first digit, represent a sectional center facility or a mail processing facility area. The fourth and fifth digits identify a post office, station, branch or local delivery area.

,Open Water,"Open water can be lakes, ponds, and reservoirs and are represented as polygons. Open water is captured at the water line's edge and does not have coincident geometry with other feature classes. Features that are less than 500 square feet in area and ornamental ponds are not captured. Streams and creeks that are wider than 10 feet are captured as open water polygons. Drainage connectors are used to represent the centerline of the water body when appropriate to maintain the hydraulic network. Stormwater ponds are not captured. This data was collected from stereo-imagery captured for the Maryland 2011 Statewide Imagery Program. Using Socet Set Softcopy workstations and VrOne, this data was compiled in accordance with industry-standard equipment and procedures. A quality management system was implemented to ensure adherence to original specifications. The purpose of this project was to produce ""new"" data in 2013 which will completely replace the existing GIS data currently being used. It was created mainly for base-mapping, map production, and spatial analysis.

,Land Cover 2011,"Anne Arundel County, Maryland is interested in monitoring its changing land cover for planning, zoning and environmental protection purposes. The county is under increasing development pressure and needs to maintain an accurate land cover database so it may guide development in a sustainable way from both economic and environmental perspectives. The land cover layer was designed and built as a continuation of hand-digitized layers compiled in the 1990s. The current layer was completed using primarily automated methods and current high-resolution aerial imagery (6 inch resolution, leaf-off), as a comparison for cost and accuracy to the earlier automated and manually-produced datasets. This version was updated in 2011 using 4-band aerial imagery collected in the spring of 2011 by the State of Maryland. Areas that have undergone change in the period 2008-2011 were updated to reflect those changes, and any inconsistencies found in the 2008 dataset were corrected. An Urban Tree Canopy dataset produced in 2008 by the University of Vermont was used to provide estimates of tree canopy for each polygon, or map unit. The database is suitable for many planning and modeling purposes, but was designed and attributed for input into hydrological water runoff and nutrient loading models.",eng,"Anne Arundel County, MD","Anne Arundel County, Maryland",Datasets,,Environment|DPW|AACo|LandCover2011|OpenData,2019-04-16T11:42:34.000Z,,,"Herald Harbor, Maryland|Deale, Maryland|Kettering, Maryland|Brooklyn Park, Maryland|Ferndale, Maryland|Talbot County, Maryland|Annapolis, Maryland|Woodmore, Maryland|Shady Side, Maryland|Galesville, Maryland|Queen Anne's County, Maryland|Mayo, Maryland|Gambrills, Maryland|Jessup, Maryland|Edgewater, Maryland|Calvert County, Maryland|Naval Academy, Maryland|Queensland, Maryland|Queen Anne, Maryland|Howard County, Maryland|Marlboro Village, Maryland|Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Highland Beach, Maryland|Fairwood, Maryland|Crofton, Maryland|Crownsville, Maryland|Brown Station, Maryland|Lake Shore, Maryland|Pasadena, Maryland|Caroline County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Friendship, Maryland|Linthicum, Maryland|Riva, Maryland|Marlton, Maryland|Brock Hall, Maryland|Severn, Maryland|Prince George's County, Maryland|Cape St. Claire, Maryland|Severna Park, Maryland|Riviera Beach, Maryland|Glenn Dale, Maryland|Annapolis Neck, Maryland|Arnold, Maryland|Odenton, Maryland|Bowie, Maryland|Arden On The Severn, Maryland|Elkridge, Maryland|Fort Meade, Maryland|Baltimore County, Maryland|Glen Burnie, Maryland|Parole, Maryland|Marlboro Meadows, Maryland|Maryland","-76.8412,38.7134,-76.3643,39.2361",Vector data,Shapefile,https://opendata.aacounty.org/datasets/7d420996b4d14707af587c647bc681fc_6,https://opendata.aacounty.org/datasets/7d420996b4d14707af587c647bc681fc_6.zip,https://gis.aacounty.org/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/Environment_OpenData/MapServer/6,,,7d420996b4d14707af587c647bc681fc_6,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/7d420996b4d14707af587c647bc681fc_6,University of Maryland,04b-24003,04b-24003,Active,ArcGIS Hub,2021-12-05,,Public,False,False,47.4972 MB
