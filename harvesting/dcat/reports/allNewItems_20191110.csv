For a one-week permit, you do not need a doctor?s certification. The one-week permit is not renewable within a one-year period.Temporary PlacardsYou can get a temporary disability placard if you have a physical condition that substantially impairs your mobility that is expected to last no longer than 8 years. Your medical practitioner must certify the application and indicate the expected length of your disability. If you find you need your disabled privileges longer, you must submit a new application with a medical practitioner's certification.Long-Term PlacardsYou can get a long-term disability if you have a long-term disability.

Orthophoto - 3 inch resolution imagery service. Data produced for the District of Columbia from 2017
digital aerial photography. It was flown in early March, completed on March 8,
2017.

Further
details included in download XML file.

Due to
technical difficulties, the downtown area is not comprised of true
orthoimagery. The contractor worked to minimize building lean by using the
increased side-lap of imagery.

The
aerial imagery acquisition was flown to support the creation of 4-band digital
orthophotography with a 3 inch/0.08 meter pixel resolution over the full
project area covering the District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square
miles. The contractor received waivers to fly in the Flight Restricted Zone
(FRZ) and P-56 areas. The ortho imagery was submitted to the District's Chief
Technology Office (OCTO) in GeoTiff/TFW format tiles following the tile scheme
provided by OCTO. MrSID and JPEG2000 compressed mosaics were delivered as well
using a 50:1 compression ratio.?

This was a critically urgent project as there are 16 distinct natural plant communities on the properties, the majority of which are at-risk around the world, in the Nation, and in the State of Michigan. Managing these natural communities for long-term conservation helps protect our Nation's rich natural heritage for this and future generations.This project produced detailed botanical inventories of each natural area on the four properties (with this specific web mapping application focused on the property at Matthaei Botanical Gardens), as well as Floristic Quality Assessment for each. Natural areas were delineated based upon plant community, and each occurence of a particular community was typically surveyed individually. These results will be used to create a set of itemized natural area stewardship recommendations, which the institution will use to:Establish long-term conservation strategies for plant populations and plant communities;Provide for the educational use of these communities while minimizing negative impacts to them, and;Direct future research on these sites by students and faculty at the University of Michigan and other colleges and universities in the region.",Flagged,,ArcGIS Hub Dataset|Esri Rest API,,,2018-01-18T18:58:01.000Z,,,Michigan,"-161.6968,-72.6727,161.6968,80.6945",Michigan,University of Michigan,University of Michigan,http://mbgna-umich.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2da3d228665041d4accca45d8b69ea7f,,https://umich.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2da3d228665041d4accca45d8b69ea7f,,,University of Michigan|Matthaei Botanical Gardens|natural communities|application|Matthaei-Nichols|Botanical Survey

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

The SSURGO dataset is a compilation of soils information collected over the last century by the?Natural Resources Conservation Service?(NRCS). Mapunits delineate the extent of different soils. Data for each mapunit contains descriptions of the soil?s components, productivity, unique?properties, and suitability interpretations.Each soil type has a unique combination of physical, chemical, nutrient and moisture properties. Soil type has ramifications for engineering and construction activities, natural hazards such as landslides, agricultural productivity, the distribution of native plant and animal life and hydrologic and other physical processes. Soil types in the context of climate and terrain can be used as a general indicator of engineering constraints, agriculture suitability, biological productivity and the natural distribution of plants and animals.Dataset SummaryThe map packages were created from the January 2018 SSURGO snapshot. The dataset covers the 48 contiguous United States plus Hawaii and portions of Alaska. Map packages are available for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. A map package for US Island Territories and associated states of the Pacific Ocean can be downloaded by clicking one of the included areas in the map. The?Pacific Map Package?includes: Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Marianas Islands, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and American Samoa.Not all areas within SSURGO have completed soil surveys and many attributes have areas with no data.?AttributesKey fields from eight commonly used SSURGO tables were compiled to create the 155 attribute fields in this layer. Some fields were joined directly to the SSURGO Map Unit polygon feature class while others required summarization and other processing to create a 1:1 relationship between the attributes and polygons prior to joining the tables. Attributes of this layer are listed below in their order of occurrence in the attribute table and are organized by the SSURGO table they originated from and the processing methods used on them.Map Unit Polygon Feature Class Attribute TableThe fields in this table are from the attribute table of the Map Unit polygon feature class which provides the geographic extent of the map units.Area SymbolSpatial VersionMap Unit SymbolMap Unit TableThe fields in this table have a 1:1 relationship with the map unit polygons and were joined to the table using the Map Unit Key field.Map Unit NameMap Unit KindFarmland ClassInterpretive FocusIntensity of MappingIowa Corn Suitability RatingLegend TableThis table has 1:1 relationship with the Map Unit table and was joined using the Legend Key field.Project ScaleSurvey Area Catalog TableThe fields in this table have a 1:1 relationship with the polygons and were joined to the Map Unit table using the Survey Area Catalog Key and Legend Key fields.Survey Area VersionTabular VersionMap Unit Aggregated Attribute TableThe fields in this table have a 1:1 relationship with the map unit polygons and were joined to the Map Unit attribute table using the Map Unit Key field.Slope Gradient - Dominant ComponentSlope Gradient - Weighted AverageBedrock Depth - MinimumWater Table Depth - Annual MinimumWater Table Depth - April to June MinimumFlooding Frequency - Dominant ConditionFlooding Frequency - MaximumPonding Frequency - PresenceAvailable Water Storage 0-25 cm - Weighted AverageAvailable Water Storage 0-50 cm - Weighted AverageAvailable Water Storage 0-100 cm - Weighted AverageAvailable Water Storage 0-150 cm - Weighted AverageDrainage Class - Dominant ConditionDrainage Class - WettestHydrologic Group - Dominant ConditionIrrigated Capability Class - Dominant ConditionIrrigated Capability Class - Proportion of Mapunit with Dominant ConditionNon-Irrigated Capability Class - Dominant ConditionNon-Irrigated Capability Class - Proportion of Mapunit with Dominant ConditionRating for Buildings without Basements - Dominant ConditionRating for Buildings with Basements - Dominant ConditionRating for Buildings with Basements - Least LimitingRating for Buildings with Basements - Most LimitingRating for Septic Tank Absorption Fields - Dominant ConditionRating for Septic Tank Absorption Fields - Least LimitingRating for Septic Tank Absorption Fields - Most LimitingRating for Sewage Lagoons - Dominant ConditionRating for Sewage Lagoons - Dominant ComponentRating for Roads and Streets - Dominant ConditionRating for Sand Source - Dominant ConditionRating for Sand Source - Most ProbableRating for Paths and Trails - Dominant ConditionRating for Paths and Trails - Weighted AverageErosion Hazard of Forest Roads and Trails - Dominant ComponentHydric Classification - PresenceRating for Manure and Food Processing Waste - Weighted AverageComponent Table ?

The information can be displayed in tables or as maps and is available for most areas in the United States and the Territories, Commonwealths, and Island Nations served by the USDA-NRCS. The information was gathered by walking over the land and observing the soil. Many soil samples were analyzed in laboratories. The maps outline areas called map units. The map units describe soils and other components that have unique properties, interpretations, and productivity. The information was collected at scales ranging from 1:12,000 to 1:63,360. More details were gathered at a scale of 1:12,000 than at a scale of 1:63,360. The mapping is intended for natural resource planning and management by landowners, townships, and counties. Some knowledge of soils data and map scale is necessary to avoid misunderstandings.The maps are linked in the database to information about the component soils and their properties for each map unit. Each map unit may contain one to three major components and some minor components. The map units are typically named for the major components. Examples of information available from the database include available water capacity, soil reaction, electrical conductivity, and frequency of flooding; yields for cropland, woodland, rangeland, and pastureland; and limitations affecting recreational development, building site development, and other engineering uses.SSURGO?datasets consist of map data, tabular data, and information about how the maps and tables were created.
