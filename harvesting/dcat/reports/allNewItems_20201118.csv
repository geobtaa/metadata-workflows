,Building Footprints,"SEMCOG maintains three separate data layers that represent information on built structures in Southeast Michigan: building footprints, building points, and condominium points. The Building Footprints were the first dataset collected. These were originally developed by using heads-up digitizing to trace the outlines of buildings in 2010 aerial photography. This process was repeated later using 2015 and 2019 imagery. Due to differences in spatial accuracy between the 2010 and later imagery sources, footprint polygons delineated using 2010 aerial photography may appear slightly shifted compared with imagery that is more recent. This dataset is current as of April 2019, and contains only three attributes: the unique building identifier, median height and the source of the footprint polygon. The Building Points dataset is a point layer representing a single point, at the center of the structure, for each building in Southeast Michigan as of April 2020. For buildings with an associated footprint polygon, the building point represents the centroid of the polygon. For newer structures, a point is placed at the approximate center of the structure as shown in recent imagery, as no footprint polygon yet exists. Since it is the building points that represent our most current universe of buildings in the region, this is the dataset on which we store the associated attributes of a building, mainly location and physical characteristics obtained from local assessing data and other sources. The Condominium Points dataset is also a point layer, with each point representing an attached condominium unit located within a building. Unlike site condominiums, attached condominiums are by definition only a portion of a single building, but as each unit can be individually owned they need to be tracked independently. To ensure an accurate match between condominium points and the building in which they are located, the condominium points are placed on the building centroid, and do not represent the actual physical location of the unit.Building AttributesAs stated above, SEMCOG maintains building attributes on the building points data layer. The condominium points and building footprints data layers have only a small subset of these attributes.

Square footage evenly divisible by 100 is an estimate, based on size and/or type of building, if the true value is unknown. Building TypesSEMCOG's building types are based on the 2017 North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). This system classifies establishments based on economic activity, is widely accepted by the planning community, and used by SEMCOG in developing its long-range socioeconomic forecasts. Each of the 22 nonresidential building types represent one or more entire 3-digit NAICS sector groupings, except for five special types of building that do not fit within this system. These specific types of activity (movie theaters, libraries, dormitories, funeral services, and parking garages) have land use and trip generation characteristics that are different from the other types of activity in their respective NAICS sector and are therefore classified individually. More information on NAICS, including descriptions of the economic activity sectors, can be found at the Census Bureau's NAICS web site. There are also four residential building types, which assist us in tracking housing development over time. Residential types are based on a combination of units in structure, and if the units can be individually owned. Single-family homes and site condominiums typically contain only one unit, but there are cases of traditional duplexes where one owner owns both units, that are also classified as single-family. Attached condo buildings contain two or more housing units in a single building, each of which shares one or more walls with an adjoining unit and can be independently owned. Multi-family housing or apartment buildings contain three or more units, all of which are owned by a single entity and intended as rental units. Figure B.1Distribution of Buildings by Type As seen in Figure B.1, over 90 percent of all buildings are single-family homes, and only 6.2 percent of buildings are of any nonresidential building type.Mobile homes are a special type of building, as it represents not a single unit but one point summarizing the total number of mobile homes located in each manufactured housing park. This is done because the units themselves are mobile, easily transportable, and the number of such units in a manufactured housing park varies on a monthly basis. We update these counts on an annual basis.There are structures that SEMCOG does not classify as buildings. To be considered a building, a structure must contain either a housing unit or a minimum of 250 square feet of nonresidential workspace. Therefore, garages, boathouses, and other accessory structures are not classified as buildings. A description of SEMCOG building types, including the relevant NAICS codes for the type, can be found in Table B.2:Table B.2Building Types by NAICS SectorBUILD TYPEDESCRIPTIONNAICS SECTORSRGB11Educational611190-232-25513Religious and Civic8130-132-16814Governmental921-9280-76-11521Retail Building441-454, 811-812255-190-19023Office Building511-551, 561255-0-031Manufacturing311-339194-158-21532Wholesale Trade423-425170-102-20533Warehouse and Storage493112-68-13741Transportation and Utility221, 481-488, 562204-204-20442Delivery Services491-492156-156-15651Health and Social Services621, 624214-157-18852Hospital622245-122-18253Residential Care Facility623137-68-10161Leisure Activity711-713137-205-10263Hotel and Motel721209-255-11565Eating and Drinking72285-255-071Agricultural111-213255-255-081Single-Family HousingResidential255-211-12782Attached Condo BuildingResidential230-152-083Multi-Family ApartmentResidential137-112-6884Mobile HomeResidential137-68-6891Movie Theater51213168-0-092Library519120-197-25593Dormitory Quarters7213192-137-6894Funeral Services81220255-127-12795Parking Garage8129378-78-78The RGB color values match SEMCOG's typical map symbology for building types.Relationship between Buildings LayersCounty land parcel layers are used to assign the unique APN (Assessor Parcel Number), as well as parcel identifier, to each structure located on a parcel by means of spatial intersection between the parcels and buildings layers. However, there are counties which do not represent parcel splits in their parcel layer when large vacant parcels are developed into single-family subdivisions. In these cases, the polygon geometry of the original parent parcel is cloned once for each new child parcel. A geospatial intersection of buildings to parcels in this situation would lead to each building in the subdivision being assigned to whichever parcel polygon happened to be sitting on top of the stack of cloned parcels. In these cases we use other sources, such as building permits and developer site plans, to identify the APN of each new building, and then assign the parcel identifier by finding the land parcel with that APN.

Since building points are the centroid of building footprints, they share the same building identifier as they reference the same structure. Condominium records are assigned a unique condo identifier, and also the building identifier of the structure they are located within. By this process, each layer has a unique identifier, and can be related to the larger parent geography as needed.Last Update: 08/18/2020",English,Southeast Michigan Council of Governments,State of Michigan,Geospatial data,,BuildingFootprints|Footprints|Buildings|BuildingOutlines|land,2020-07-08T16:29:37.000Z,,,,Michigan,"['-83.6981', '42.0402', '-82.8598', '42.8932']",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/72152aba68924bc29c9af749172c7918_0,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/72152aba68924bc29c9af749172c7918_0.zip,,https://services1.arcgis.com/xUx8EjNc6egUPYWh/arcgis/rest/services/Building_Footprints/FeatureServer/0,,72152aba68924bc29c9af749172c7918_0,Michigan State,06a-01,06a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Stream Rivers Assessment Units - 2018,"The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires Michigan to prepare a biennial report on the quality of its water resources as the principal means of conveying water quality protection/monitoring information to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the United States Congress. The Integrated Report satisfies the listing requirements of Section 303(d) and the reporting requirements of Section 305(b) and 314 of the CWA.

,School COVID-19 Cases by The Covid Monitor,"For full metadata and data details, visitTheCovidMonitor.comHow we gather and publish dataState agencies and school districtsIf a state's health or education office releases data about cases in schools, we use that data first. If districts are reporting independently of their state, we consider that official, authoritative data, as well. This data is considered our most authoritative resource for cases in K-12 schools across the country.News and mediaNews articles, press releases, and interviews with school officials with local media help keep our region managers up to date on cases in their focus areas. We make sure each article we use to verify information includes a statement from the school or school district, whether directly or through emails/letters sent to parents.If the article relates to a school district and/or state that is already reporting, we check to make sure the numbers line up, and inquire with the school, state or district if they don't.If the article relates to a school or districtnotreporting in any official capacity, in a state that does not report cases, we build a file for that districts and remove any duplicate reports before adding the cases.Public reportingThe public depends on us to keep them informed, and we depend on communities to help us do that. By submitting information about cases throughour safe and 100% anonymous form, parents, teachers and even students keep us and each other up-to-date with the latest information available.Verifying Public ReportsHow we verify public reports depends on the type of report we receive. Reports with links to information are most likely to be added to our dataset, though we work to investigate those cases where additional information is needed.If we receive a report that links us to an official district or state website, we add the data to our official counts without any other needed steps, and we keep the link to the resource for future use.If a reports includes a link to a news article, press release or other official publications where a school official has confirmed the cases reported, we add that information to our counts.If we receive a report with a letter or email from a school, or if no official data resource is available to verify the information submitted, we first reach out to the school itself to get confirmation. If the school does not outright deny the report, we look for additional resources to verify the information, either through additional reports we've received, social media posts, and school contacts that cannot speak on the record, but are trusted resources.Even if we can't confirm a report with 100% certainty, we keep the report in our ""pending"" data until more information is received.Best Practices for Data ReportingInformation is one of our most important tools in this pandemic. Reporting cases and information related to COVID-19 timely is very important because we need good data to make informed decisions. Here is a list of things to consider when reporting data for your school.Keep patient data confidentialDon't publish names or any other kind of identifying information.Even if names are redacted, enough information about an individual can be sufficient to identify them.Take accessibility into considerationPublished information should be easily accessible to people even if they have special accessibility requirements, such as screen readers.Simpler formats, such tables on web pages, work much better for all kinds of users.Publish timely updates of the dataData should be updated timely and regularly.The latest data is useful, but historical data is very important as well.Historical data can be used to assess effectiveness of policies, such as specific guidelines regarding mask usage and social distancing.Historical data can be corrected if mistakes are made.Use consistent formattingUsing a consistent formatting makes it easier for students and parents to understand what it says.Consistent formatting enables others to make use of this data for a variety of purposes, from dashboards to research.State data report cardsWe grade states based on how much detail they provide at the state, district and school level.There are three primary levels of reporting data: state totals, totals by district, and totals by school, as shown in the chart below. We're working to include additional granularity in reporting grades- like whether or not states are reporting totals by case type (students versus staff), school or grade level (elementary, middle and high), and additional details related to cases in schools (e.g. quarantines). This grade is specific to data about cases in K-12 schools, and not related to any other type or level of data reported by the state. What is considered ""limited"" reporting?States often report limited data of each of the three main subject areas, meaning they will only specify the number of cases per district or school if a certain number of cases have been confirmed there. In South Carolina, districts with fewer than five cases are shown as ""<5."" Other states only report cases related to ""outbreaks,"" a definition that also varies by state. If the data data is masked or restricted in any way, it's considered ""limited"" reporting.",English,COVID Action,Esri,Geospatial data,,Florida|COVID|Monitor|Action|Watch|Case|Count|Tally|search|info|data|source|state|agency|education|teacher|staff|report|anonymous|official|K-12|K12|COVID19|COVID-19|Coronavirus|school|middle|elementary|high|safe,2020-09-04T00:36:32.000Z,,,,United States,"['-177.3500', '-14.2672', '179.6212', '69.4493']",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/35bafb81f59d40399e75743ac9b04d7b_0,https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/35bafb81f59d40399e75743ac9b04d7b_0.zip,,https://services2.arcgis.com/QTlu74VtgQxQNkN3/arcgis/rest/services/Official_School_COVID_19_Case_Counts_by_The_Covid_Monitor/FeatureServer/0,,35bafb81f59d40399e75743ac9b04d7b_0,,99-1000,99-1000,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Locations,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Hosted Feature Layer for accessing the MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data product.MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data consists of linear & point geometric features which represent geographic locations & segments of roadway showing traffic volume throughout the State of Maryland.Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs, located throughout Maryland. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA). A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where ""0"" represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), ""1"" represents the count taken in 2013, ""2"" represents the count taken in 2012, ""3"" represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is a strategic resource for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), as well as many other State and local government agencies.

,MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Segments,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Hosted Feature Layer for accessing the MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data product.MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data consists of linear & point geometric features which represent geographic locations & segments of roadway showing traffic volume throughout the State of Maryland.Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs, located throughout Maryland. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA). A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where ""0"" represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), ""1"" represents the count taken in 2013, ""2"" represents the count taken in 2012, ""3"" represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is a strategic resource for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), as well as many other State and local government agencies. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of State highway improvement and safety programs. The MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet MDOT SHA's long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements.Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year.

Rates are calculated and displayed per 100,000 population. Rates were spatially smoothed using a Local Empirical Bayes algorithm to stabilize risk by borrowing information from neighboring geographic areas, making estimates more statistically robust and stable for counties with small populations. Data for counties with small populations are coded as '-1' when a reliable rate could not be generated. County-level rates were generated when the following criteria were met over a 3-year time period within each of the filters (e.g., age, race, and gender).At least one of the following 3 criteria: At least 20 events occurred within the county and its adjacent neighbors.ORAt least 16 events occurred within the county.ORAt least 5,000 population years within the county.AND all 3 of the following criteria:At least 6 population years for each age group used for age adjustment if that age group had 1 or more event.The number of population years in an age group was greater than the number of events.At least 100 population years within the county.More Questions?Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and StrokeData SourcesStatistical Methods ",English,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Esri,Geospatial data,,StrokeMortality|CDC|Stroke|StrokeDeaths,2020-06-01T21:26:38.000Z,,,,United States,"['-178.2176', '-14.3756', '145.8512', '71.4062']",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/713d4cd763e24507b2b7688b96ab9416_0,https://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/713d4cd763e24507b2b7688b96ab9416_0.zip,,https://services3.arcgis.com/ZvidGQkLaDJxRSJ2/arcgis/rest/services/Stroke_Mortality/FeatureServer/0,,713d4cd763e24507b2b7688b96ab9416_0,,99-1100,99-1100,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE
,U.S. High Blood Pressure Medication Nonadherence 2017,"Create maps of U.S. blood pressure medication nonadherence among Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged 65 and older, by county. Data can be stratified by race/ethnicity and blood pressure medication class. Blood pressure medication nonadherence is defined as a proportion of days a beneficiary was covered with blood pressure medication of <80%.Visit the CDC/DHDSP Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke for additional data and maps. Atlas of Heart Disease and StrokeData Source and MethodologyAntihypertensive nonadherence, defined as a proportion of days a beneficiary was covered with antihypertensives of <80%, was assessed using prescription drug claims data among Medicare Advantage or Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with Medicare Part D coverage. Administrative data and prescription drug event data were accessed via the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive class, beneficiaries' state and county of residence, type of prescription drug plan, and treatment and demographic characteristics. Visit the Vital Signs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for more detailed information.Data DictionaryData for counties with small populations are not displayed when a reliable rate could not be generated. These counties are represented in the data with values of '-1.' CDC/DHDSP excludes these values when classifying the data on a map, indicating those counties as 'Insufficient Data.'
