The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December.

The original AWATER and ALAND fields are still available as attributes within the data table (units are square meters).The States layer contains 52 records - all US states, Washington D.C., and Puerto RicoCensus tracts with no population that occur in areas of water, such as oceans, are removed from this data service (Census Tracts beginning with 99).Percentages and derived counts, and associated margins of error, are calculated values (that can be identified by the ""_calc_"" stub in the field name), and abide by the specificationsdefined by the American Community Survey.Field alias names were created based on the Table Shellsfile available from theAmerican Community Survey Summary File Documentation page.Negative values (e.g., -4444...) have been set to null, with the exception of -5555... which has been set to zero. These negative values exist in the raw API data to indicate the following situations:The margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.Either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution.The median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution, or in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.The estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate.The data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.",eng,Esri,Esri,Datasets,,AmericanCommunitySurvey|ACS|Census|CensusBureau|demographics|people|states|counties|tracts|2010-2014|healthinsurance|uninsured|age|race|sex|demographics|AmericanCommunitySurvey|policy|atrisk,2020-12-01T05:09:00.000Z,,,United States,"-179.1474,17.8848,179.7785,71.3526",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/1de77825c6af4da1aab7b51ed8cb9b64_1,https://gisdata-dupage.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/24f9d9881a204890bff3ccbfd72ddd3e_0.zip,,,,1de77825c6af4da1aab7b51ed8cb9b64_1,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/1de77825c6af4da1aab7b51ed8cb9b64_1,,99-1100,99-1100,Active,ArcGIS Hub,2021-07-16,,Public,False,False,0.2702 MB

,Scoping Freight,"Several layers were examined as part of the highway improvement needs analysis conducted for the 2017 State Transportation Plan. Freight needs aligned with highway freight bottlenecks identified in the 2016 Iowa State Freight Plan. A combination of INRIX travel time data and input from internal and external stakeholders was used to identify bottleneck locations. Bottlenecks were then ranked through an analysis of each location's value, condition, and performance (VCAP). Value was based on how much each location increased the efficiency of the highway network for trucks; condition was based on the Infrastructure Condition Evaluation (ICE) tool's analysis of condition and traffic data; and performance was based on the INRIX bottleneck ranking tool. Locations were ranked, with annual average truck traffic data being used as a tiebreaker.

,Scoping Mobility Safety,"Several layers were examined as part of the highway improvement needs analysis conducted for the 2017 State Transportation Plan. Mobility and safety needs on the Primary Highway System were evaluated in order to target corridors where capacity needs were not identified, but corridor operation could be enhanced with improvements such as climbing/passing lanes, left- and right-turn lanes, acceleration lanes, wider paved shoulders, limited access, and geometric improvements. Improvements would be similar to a relaxed application of the ""Super-2"" design concept. Over time, the targeted corridors would serve as a complimentary network to the state's multilane highway network.

,Scoping Capacity,"Several layers were examined as part of the highway improvement needs analysis conducted for the 2017 State Transportation Plan. Future capacity needs on the Primary Highway System were evaluated for the year 2040 with the Iowa Travel Analysis model (iTRAM). A volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio was used, which divides the roadway's forecast traffic by its capacity. A corridor is targeted to have a capacity need if the majority of its V/C values exceed 0.7, which is considered to be approaching capacity. Needs were identified at the corridor level; spot locations, generally defined as 0.5 miles in length, were not included as corridors.

,2020 Impaired Lakes of Iowa,"This dataset represents the centroids of lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands that were listed as ""impaired"" in Iowa's 2020 Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment and the 303(d) Impaired Waters Report. Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2020 Integrated Report. Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"". New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",eng,Iowa Department of Natural Resources,State of

,2020 Impaired Streams of Iowa,"This dataset contains line work that representing streams and rivers listed as ""impaired"" in Iowa's 2020 Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment and the 303(d) Impaired Waters Report. Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2020 Integrated Report. Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"". New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",eng,Iowa Department of Natural Resources,State of

,Foreign Trade Zones,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer for accessing the Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data.Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data consists of polygon geometric features which represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations throughout the State of Maryland. Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries' data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member jurisdictions has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland- City of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown / Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury / Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S / WMPO)- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland- City of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). Being a subset of the USDOT's NTAD, an annual update of Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is performed by TSO in close coordination with each MPO, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). MPO Boundaries data is a strategic resource for the USDOT, FHWA, MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State, and local government agencies. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is updated on an annual basis.For additional MPO information, contact MDOT's Office of Planning and Capital Programming:Email:MDOTGIS@mdot.maryland.govFor additional

,National Capital Strategic Economic Development Areas,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer for accessing the Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data.Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data consists of polygon geometric features which represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations throughout the State of Maryland. Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries' data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member jurisdictions has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland- City of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown / Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury / Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S / WMPO)- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland- City of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT).

Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries' data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed.

Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process.

,Arts and Entertainment Districts,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer for accessing the Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data.Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data consists of polygon geometric features which represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations throughout the State of Maryland. Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries' data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member jurisdictions has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland- City of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown / Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury / Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S / WMPO)- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland- City of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). Being a subset of the USDOT's NTAD, an annual update of Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is performed by TSO in close coordination with each MPO, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). MPO Boundaries data is a strategic resource for the USDOT, FHWA, MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State, and local government agencies.

,Sustainable Communities,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer for accessing the Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data.Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data consists of polygon geometric features which represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations throughout the State of Maryland. Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries' data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member jurisdictions has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland- City of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown / Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury / Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S / WMPO)- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland- City of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). Being a subset of the USDOT's NTAD, an annual update of Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is performed by TSO in close coordination with each MPO, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). MPO Boundaries data is a strategic resource for the USDOT, FHWA, MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State, and local government agencies. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is updated on an annual basis.For additional MPO information, contact MDOT's Office of Planning and Capital Programming:Email:MDOTGIS@mdot.maryland.govFor additional

,One Maryland Jurisdictions,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer for accessing the Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data.Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data consists of polygon geometric features which represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations throughout the State of Maryland. Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries' data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member jurisdictions has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland- City of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown / Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury / Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S / WMPO)- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland- City of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). Being a subset of the USDOT's NTAD, an annual update of Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is performed by TSO in close coordination with each MPO, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). MPO Boundaries data is a strategic resource for the USDOT, FHWA, MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State, and local government agencies. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is updated on an annual basis.For additional MPO information, contact MDOT's Office of Planning and Capital Programming:Email:MDOTGIS@mdot.maryland.govFor additional

,Designated Transit Oriented Development -TOD Areas,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer for accessing the Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data.Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) Boundaries data consists of polygon geometric features which represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations throughout the State of Maryland. Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries' data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (""3âC"") planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member jurisdictions has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland- City of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown / Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury / Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S / WMPO)- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland- City of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT).
