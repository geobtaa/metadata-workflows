Accordingly, the Iowa DOT has established an access management policy to control access to the Primary Highway System. When right-of-way was obtained for the establishment of the primary highway system, the Iowa Department of Transportation obtained access rights that allow the DOT to restrict direct access to the primary highway.

To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list.

This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year.

c8c9774446ce4baaaaec5f58bb43091f,04a-01,Maryland Incentive Zones: Opportunity Zones & Sustainable Communities,,"Maryland Incentive Zones include Opportunity Zones  Sustainable Communities. This interactive map displays both of these areas and includes a feature for their corresponding coincident geographies.The Opportunity Zone program is a nationwide initiative administered by the U.S. Treasury created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The program provides federal tax incentives for investment in distressed communities over the next 10 years. Areas designated as Opportunity Zones will be able to reap the benefits of capital gains to help redevelop undeserved communities. The state was entitled to nominate 149 low-income census tracts to be Opportunity Zones. Once the U.S. Treasury has approved the state?s Opportunity Zone nominations, the designation will be effective for 10 years. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development will administer the program with support from the Maryland Department of Commerce.The interim Sustainable Communities designation will continue for a transition period and local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued designation. The term of the transition period is as follows: Existing Designated Neighborhoods will automatically become Sustainable Communities effective June 1, 2010. The designation will continue for a period of 24 months, during which time local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued Sustainable Communities designation. Community Legacy Areas designated prior to January 1, 2008 will become Sustainable Community for 24 months after June 1, 2010. Existing Community Legacy Areas designated on or after January 1, 2008 will be considered Sustainable Communities for a period of 36 months after June 1, 2010. An application procedure is being developed for local governments to request continued Sustainable Communities designation beyond the transition period. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will begin accepting applications for Sustainable Communities in the Fall of 2010. Applications for Sustainable Communities designation will be reviewed by an interagency panel led by DHCD and must be approved by the Governor?s Smart Growth Subcabinet. Once approved, newly designated Sustainable Communities (those that apply after June 1, 2010) will retain their designation for a period of five years. Sustainable Communities also include designated Transit Oriented Development Zones (TOD?s) and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Zones. These areas are automatically considered Sustainable Communities effective June 1, 2010 and do not need to reapply for continued designation. The first, second, and some of the third and fourth rounds have been updated.More info on Opportunity Zones:?https://data-maryland.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/maryland-incentive-zones-opportunity-zonesMore info on Sustainable Communities:?https://data-maryland.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/maryland-incentive-zones-sustainable-communities",Flagged,,ArcGIS Hub Dataset|Esri Rest API,,,2019-05-09T14:58:21.000Z,,,Maryland,"-79.409,37.635,-75.179,39.955",Maryland,State of Maryland,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/c8c9774446ce4baaaaec5f58bb43091f,,https://maryland.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=c8c9774446ce4baaaaec5f58bb43091f,,,Story Map|Map Journal|MDOT|MDOT ORED|Sustainable Communities|Opportunity Zones|Bernish|MDOT TSO|Economic Development|Real Estate|Real Estate Development|Sustainability|Maryland|Vector Tile Style Editor

Transit-oriented development is not any type of growth
occurring near transit station. Instead, TOD features a well-designed and
relatively high intensity of mixed land uses within a comfortable walk of a
rail or bus transit station.

TODs are generally higher density developments comprising a mix of residential, office, commercial, and civic uses in a pedestrian friendly environment within walking distance of a transit center. In 2008 the Maryland legislature adopted a formal definition for TOD as a dense, mixed-use, deliberately planned development within a half-mile of transit stations that is designed to increase transit ridership.Official?designation of a TOD was enabled under statute in 2008. ?The intent of designation is to facilitate MDOT?s more direct involvement in the above activities, by clarifying that in specific project areas (which must be within a half mile of a transit station), TOD is to be considered as a transportation purpose. ?By statute, TODs are to be automatically included in the interagency Sustainable Community designation, which implies eligibility/prioritization for several state discretionary programs and expanded scope for local use of Tax Increment Finance (TIF) for related projects.The?local jurisdiction with land use authority may?nominate a project as part of their annual ?priority letter? for MDOT (generally due in April/May). Staff works with local jurisdiction to define the nomination and collect background materials. Final materials are vetted with the Secretary?of Transportation and the Smart Growth Sub-cabinet for recommendation.?The?Secretary?of Transportation conveys the outcomes of the review process, and offers official designation to local jurisdictions as appropriate.? Local jurisdictions then take action to formalize the agreement (including boundaries) by official resolution. When this step is complete, the project is considered to be officially ?designated.?The designation does not imply that any specific funding or assistance will be automatically allocated.? Needs and expectations of support from both state and local agencies should be clarified as part of the designation process.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2019-02-26T20:43:30.000Z,,,Maryland,"-77.1698,38.8242,-76.1623,39.5094",Maryland,State of Maryland,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/ac656c99fc3245db81347c994693f175_2,"http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/ac656c99fc3245db81347c994693f175_2.zip?outSR={""latestWkid"":2248,""wkid"":102685}",https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/Maryland_Designated_Transit_Oriented_Development_Sites/FeatureServer/2,,FeatureServer,Maryland|Transit Oriented Development|Transit-Oriented Development|MDOT|Real Estate|Transit|Economic Development|Incentive Zone|Maryland Incentive Zones|Bernish
