,MDOT SHA 2050 Mean Higher High Water 0% Annual Chance (No Storm) - Flood Depth Grid,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer which providesaccess to the MDOT SHA 2050 Mean Higher High Water 0% Annual Chance (No Storm) - Depth Grid data product.MDOT SHA 2050 Mean Higher High Water 0% Annual Chance (No Storm) - Depth Grid consists of a depth grid image service depicting the projected conditions of mean higher high water based on the 0% annual chance (No Storm) event scenario for coastal areas throughout the State of Maryland in year 2050. This data product supports Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) leadership and planners as they endeavor to mitigate or prevent the impacts of sea level change resulting from land surface subsidence and rising sea levels.MDOT SHA 2050 Mean Higher High Water 0% Annual Chance (No Storm) - Depth Griddata was produced as a result of efforts by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC), Salisbury University (SU), United States Corps of Engineers (USACE), NationalOceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). TheUS Army Corps of Engineers provide the sea level change estimate. Sea level changeis localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations are transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988. A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land creates ansea level changevalue for the official project year, 2100.MDOT SHA 2050Mean Higher High Water0% Annual Chance (No Storm) - Depth Grid data is owned by theMDOT SHA Innovative Planning & Performance Division (IPPD). TheEastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC)is the developer / creator of this data product, and continues to maintain & host the data as apublicly available image service.

,Road Separated Bike Routes AND Connectors,"This version contains Road-Separated Bike Routes AND the connectors to the road network.""Road Separated"" indicates that these segments are physically separated from roads in which motorized vehicles travel. That is, these are not bike lanes, sharrows, or signed bike routes per se - these segments are separated from the main road by a physical barrier (E.g., grass, natural earth, trees, etc.) and in many instances do not follow a motorized vehicle route network at all (E.g., a wholly separated trail). This information in this web map will be used in conjunction with the One Maryland One Centerline (OMOC) initiative to provide a Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) map for the State of Maryland. The recommended LTS score for each road-separated bicycle route is listed in the pop-up menu.Bikeways included in the map are of varying surface material but are typically paved or hard-packed surface. Sidewalks, typically 6-feet-wide, hard surface pathways primarily for pedestrian use, are not included in this map. The preferred width of bikeways included is at least 10-feet wide, although bikeways may be narrower if anticipated traffic volumes are minimal. For instance, while most pathways within Columbia are 8 to 10 feet wide, some pathways are narrower when connecting to cul-du-sacs. These narrower pathways are included in the map as the anticipated traffic volume are low enough to minimize user conflict. The feature class used in the web map was compiled by the Maryland Department of Transportation (Secretary's Office) using a variety of sources including (but not limited to) state data sources from various agencies including the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Planning (MDP), and Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Data has also been augmented by counties and municipalities throughout the State of Maryland as well as several agencies, organizations, and conservancies. Certain named trails are included within this dataset and their sources have varied from state, local, and non-profits as well as through the digitizing of various aerial/satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), right-of-ways, former railways, and corridors by MDOT staff. None of the alignments included in this dataset are restricted to private use.The searchable data includes attribute information containing the route's name (if applicable), calculated segment length (using the Maryland State Plane 1983 Projection), and Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) score. The data mostly contains alignment segments with a LTS of 0, the lowest score. This score indicates that the bikeway can be comfortably used by cyclists of all levels and experience and has minimal automobile traffic interaction. There are several segments with LTS scores of 1 or 2 within this feature class as well, but these are mostly connector paths/trails between larger segments. LTS scores of 1 or 2 indicate very little automobile traffic and/or slower speeds required for the automobile traffic.ATTRIBUTES:Route Name (if Applicable): The name of the route is provided if the route is namedCounties within Route: The counties in Maryland through which the route passes are listedRoute's Length: The route distance is calculated and listed in miles. Note that this is the length of the entire named route - and not just the segment selected. Distance calculated using the NAD 1983 StatePlane Maryland FIPS 1900 (US Feet) Projection.LTS Score: Level of Traffic Stress. For this map (road-separated routes) the scores range from 0 (road-separated) to 2 (generally low traffic). The areas that are not 0 in this map/data represent portions of the road-separated routes that cross streets or have portions that are briefly on-road as connections.

,Homicide Reduction Partnership Areas,"Homicide Reduction Partnership, a collaborative effort to reduce violent crime through strategic prevention and focused enforcement. With this new partnership, MPD will focus resources and intelligence-led policing strategies in collaboration with local and federal law enforcement and criminal justice partners, DC government agencies, and community partners.The Homicides Reduction Partnership (HRP) will focus on reducing violent crime within four Police Service Areas throughout the entire 2022 calendar year. These areas include PSAs 603, 604, 706 and 708, which accounted for 21% of all murders city-wide in 2021. The objective of the HRP is to use a ""whole of government"" approach to reduce violent crime, have a positive impact on the community's perception of safety and security, and increase trust among residents in the police and DC government. By committing an entire year, the goal is to sustain success after the conclusion of the initiative.For more information visit https://dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announces-new-year-round-partnership-focused-violent-crime",eng,D.C.

,Long Range Plan 2050 Planning Areas,"PLANNING AREAS All Connections 2050 Long-Range Plan elements are available online at www.dvrpc.org/plan. The Plan has two primary documents:(1) The Connections 2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027) identifies the vision, goals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.(2) The Connections 2050 Process and Analysis Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028) provides a more detailed look at the Plan's outreach, background information, analysis, and financial plan.Greater Philadelphia is a complex mosaic of 352 diverse cities, boroughs, and townships. The Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan characterizes each of the region's municipalities as either a Core City, Developed Community, Growing Suburb, or Rural Area, as a means of categorizing the types of communities and defining the corresponding long-range planning policies most appropriate for each type. This categorization is shown on the Planning Areas and Centers dataset. Many municipalities have areas within their boundaries that fit the characteristics of more than one of these Planning Area types. Gloucester Township (in Camden County, New Jersey), for example, has neighborhoods that are fully developed, but it also has a significant number of undeveloped acres and forecasted population and employment growth more characteristic of a Growing Suburb. The intent of the Plan is to assign to each municipality the planning area type associated with the long-range planning policies that will be most beneficial to the entire community. While the Planning Areas and Centers map is a guide for policy direction at the regional scale, actual approaches should always be guided by local conditions.The region's four Core Cities are Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester. Targeted infrastructure investment, maintenance and rehabilitation, comprehensive neighborhood revitalization, and efforts focused on reinforcing a network of social and educational programs will help to rebuild and revitalize the region's cities.Developed Communities are places that have already experienced most of their population and employment growth, and include inner ring communities adjacent to the Core Cities; railroad boroughs and trolley car communities; and mature suburban townships. Many of these communities are stable and thriving, offering affordable housing opportunities; access to transit; safe pedestrian and bicycling environments; and a strong community identity. Others, however, are experiencing population and employment losses; have deteriorating infrastructure systems; have aging resident populations living on limited incomes; and have stagnant or declining tax bases that cannot keep pace with rising service demands. Rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure systems and the housing stock, and local economic and community development can help to reinforce location advantages, while stabilizing neighborhoods and stemming decline.Growing Suburbs are communities that have a significant number of developable acres remaining and are experiencing or are forecast to experience significant population and/or employment growth. Key planning policies in these communities focus on the need to improve the form of development, reduce congestion, and mitigate the negative consequences of unmanaged growth, and include growth management and enhanced community design. Smart growth techniques that support a more concentrated development pattern (such as clustering, mixed uses, transit-oriented development, and transfer of development rights) can provide the critical mass necessary to support new transit services and other alternatives to the automobile. The quality of design and architectural character of the built environment, open space preservation, and the creation of an integrated system of open space and recreation are all priorities in these communities.Rural Areas include the region's agricultural communities and communities with large remaining natural areas.

,Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory for Greater Philadelphia,"Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory for Greater Philadelphiahttps://www.dvrpc.org/Products/18018Energy Use is defined as the BBTU (Billion British Thermal Units) equivalent of energy consumed by end point users. For electricity this is the BBTU equivalent of the electricity at point of consumption, not the heat content of the fuels used for electricity generation.Emissions (MTCO2E - Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) from the following sectors and fuel sources are not included in this allocation: enteric fermentation and manure management; commerical and general aviation; marine and port-related activity; off-road vehicles and equipment; freight and intercity passenger rail; coal; fuels used predominently in the industrial sector (e.g., petroleum coke); and land use, land use change, and forestry.Population and Employment data used in this analysis came from DVRPC's Municipal-level Poulation and Employment Forecasts.GEOID_10 - Unique GIS ID for Municipality.ACRES - Total Municipal Acres.USEACRES - Energy Use per Acres (BBTUs).EUPOPEM - Energy Use per Person/Job (BBTUs).EMIACRE - GHG Emissions per Acre (MTCO2E).EMPOPE - GHG Emissions per Person/Job (MTCO2E).EMSQACRE - GHG Emissions/Sequestration including Land Use, Land Use Change, and Foresty per Acres (MTCO2E).EMSQPOPE - GHG Emissions/Sequestration including Land Use, Land Use Change, and Foresty per Person/Job (MTCO2E).DVRPC estimates that net GHG emissions decreased 10 percent from 2010 to 2015, from emissions equivalent to the release of 82 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (MMTCO2e) to about 74 MMTCO2e. GHG emissions were 21 percent lower in 2015 than in 2005. The top three drivers of reductions between 2010 and 2015 were, in decreasing levels of significance, change in electricity generation mix (a cleaner electricity grid due to the continued switch from coal to natural gas), decreased on-road emissions per mile traveled, and decreased electricity consumption per household. Continued reductions will require sustained, concerted and aggressive action at the household, firm, community, regional, state, national, and global level, as well as continued technical advancement.

,Long-Range Plan 2045 Planning Areas,"PLANNING AREAS http://www.dvrpc.org/ (add link to 2045 Long-Range Plan document when available)Greater Philadelphia is a complex mosaic of 352 diverse cities, boroughs, and townships. The Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan characterizes each of the region's municipalities as either a Core City, Developed Community, Growing Suburb, or Rural Area, as a means of categorizing the types of communities and defining the corresponding long-range planning policies most appropriate for each type. This categorization is shown on the Planning Areas and Centers dataset. Many municipalities have areas within their boundaries that fit the characteristics of more than one of these Planning Area types. Gloucester Township (in Camden County, New Jersey), for example, has neighborhoods that are fully developed, but it also has a significant number of undeveloped acres and forecasted population and employment growth more characteristic of a Growing Suburb. The intent of the Plan is to assign to each municipality the planning area type associated with the long-range planning policies that will be most beneficial to the entire community. While the Planning Areas and Centers map is a guide for policy direction at the regional scale, actual approaches should always be guided by local conditions.The region's four Core Cities are Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester. Targeted infrastructure investment, maintenance and rehabilitation, comprehensive neighborhood revitalization, and efforts focused on reinforcing a network of social and educational programs will help to rebuild and revitalize the region's cities.Developed Communities are places that have already experienced most of their population and employment growth, and include inner ring communities adjacent to the Core Cities; railroad boroughs and trolley car communities; and mature suburban townships. Many of these communities are stable and thriving, offering affordable housing opportunities; access to transit; safe pedestrian and bicycling environments; and a strong community identity. Others, however, are experiencing population and employment losses; have deteriorating infrastructure systems; have aging resident populations living on limited incomes; and have stagnant or declining tax bases that cannot keep pace with rising service demands. Rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure systems and the housing stock, and local economic and community development can help to reinforce location advantages, while stabilizing neighborhoods and stemming decline.Growing Suburbs are communities that have a significant number of developable acres remaining and are experiencing or are forecast to experience significant population and/or employment growth. Key planning policies in these communities focus on the need to improve the form of development, reduce congestion, and mitigate the negative consequences of unmanaged growth, and include growth management and enhanced community design. Smart growth techniques that support a more concentrated development pattern (such as clustering, mixed uses, transit-oriented development, and transfer of development rights) can provide the critical mass necessary to support new transit services and other alternatives to the automobile. The quality of design and architectural character of the built environment, open space preservation, and the creation of an integrated system of open space and recreation are all priorities in these communities.Rural Areas include the region's agricultural communities and communities with large remaining natural areas. Key policy approaches for these communities focus on preservation and limiting development, and include limited expansion of infrastructure systems, preservation of a rural lifestyle and village character, support for continued farming, and enhanced natural resource protection. Livable communities in these areas include rural centers that have an identi fi able main street, a mix of uses, higher densities than their surrounding uses, and a true sense of place.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The characteristics of each type are as follows:SUBURBAN CENTERSAre regionally significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are perceived as single ""places;"" Are suburban in character; Are less dense than town centers; Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers;Are defined primarily by a concentration and variety of office, retail, professional, and light industrial uses, and generally have more jobs than residents; and are generally auto dependent rather than transit oriented or pedestrian scale.TOWN CENTERSHave a mixture of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an integrated mix of land uses;Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than their surrounding land uses;Have a distinct downtown/main street area surrounded by relatively dense residential development;Are pedestrian friendly and often transit oriented; and Are surrounded by suburban land uses.RURAL CENTERS Have a minimum density of six people and three employees per developed acre; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area;Have a distinct downtown/main street (though smaller than a town center); and Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses. PLANNED CENTERSAre planned town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas or through redevelopment on greyfields and/or brownfields in Developed Communities; and Have plans that call for village-type development, incorporating mixed, integrated land uses, relatively high densities, and pedestrian connections.

,"Long-Range Plan 2045 Planned Centers, Core Cities & Neighborhood Centers","PLANNED CENTERS, CORE CITIES & NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERSConnections 2045 Plan for Greater Philadelphia - Administrative Version DVRPC Publication No. 17039 12/2017The concept of Centers is the cornerstone of the Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan. Centers provide a focal point in the regional landscape that recognizes the regional and local significance of places, while reinforcing a sense of community for local residents. Centers serve as a basis for organizing and focusing the development landscape and provide a framework for the most efficient provision of supportive infrastructure systems, including water, sewer, and transportation. By concentrating growth around and within Centers, the region can both preserve open space and reduce infrastructure costs. The densities and mixed uses inherent within Centers can enhance the feasibility of walking, bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile. Connections 2040identifies a hierarchy of seven Center types, shown on the Planning Areas and Centers map, based on their role and activities within the region.METROPOLITAN CENTERCenter City/University City/Camden Central Business District — spanning the Delaware River and bounded roughly by 40th Street from Girard to Washington avenues in Philadelphia and by the Ben Franklin Bridge and Interstate 676 to Clinton Street in Camden — is identified as the region's Metropolitan Center. This dense, compact, mixed-use area includes the central business districts of Philadelphia and Camden, major academic and medical institutions, and major tourist and entertainment destinations.METROPOLITAN SUBCENTERSThe Plan also identifies six Metropolitan Subcenters, reflecting their magnitude of jobs and commercial activity. These include the downtown area of Trenton and the destinations of King of Prussia/Valley Forge (Montgomery and Chester counties); International Airport (Delaware and Philadelphia counties), Navy Yard/Sports Complex (Philadelphia); Cherry Hill/Mount Laurel/Marlton (Burlington and Camden counties); and the Route 1 Corridor (Mercer County).NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERSConnections 2040recognizes that each of the region's Core Cities is a collection of diverse neighborhoods with varying characteristics, assets, challenges, and needs, and that specific approaches and strategies for improving and revitalizing these neighborhoods will differ. The planning policies within the Core Cities and their neighborhoods focus on redevelopment and revitalization through targeted investment and reinvestment. Embedded within the region's Core Cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester are Neighborhood Centers, which are recognizable places with a mix of commercial, retail, anchor institutional, and residential activities. Neighborhood Centers have an identifiable main street or focal point, are walkable, and have a unique history or sense of a community within the larger city setting. In addition to the metropolitan center, metropolitan subcenters, and neighborhood centers, the Plan identifies four other types of Centers: Suburban Centers, Town Centers, Rural Centers, and Planned Centers. The characteristics of each type are as follows:SUBURBAN CENTERSAre regionally significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are perceived as single ""places;"" Are suburban in character; Are less dense than town centers; Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers; Are defined primarily by a concentration and variety of office, retail, professional, and light industrial uses, and generally have more jobs than residents; and are generally auto dependent rather than transit oriented or pedestrian scale.TOWN CENTERSHave a mixture of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than their surrounding land uses; Have a distinct downtown/main street area surrounded by relatively dense residential development; Are pedestrian friendly and often transit oriented; and Are surrounded by suburban land uses.RURAL CENTERSHave a minimum density of six people and three employees per developed acre; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area; Have a distinct downtown/main street (though smaller than a town center); and Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses. PLANNED CENTERSAre planned town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas or through redevelopment on greyfields and/or brownfields in Developed Communities; and Have plans that call for village-type development, incorporating mixed, integrated land uses, relatively high densities, and pedestrian connections.",eng,DVRPC-GIS,Delaware Valley,Datasets,,DVRPC|Connections2045|Long-RangePlan|PlannedCenters|CoreCities|NeighborhoodCenters,2022-03-08T19:00:50.000Z,,,"Ardentown, Delaware|New Castle County, Delaware|Elsmere, Delaware|Ardencroft, Delaware|Bellefonte, Delaware|Arden, Delaware|Newport, Delaware|Delaware|Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Chester, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Coatesville, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Berks County, Pennsylvania|Chester County, Pennsylvania|Reading, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington, New Jersey|Beverly, New Jersey|Woodbury, New Jersey|Gloucester City, New Jersey|Camden County, New Jersey|Bordentown, New Jersey|Camden, New Jersey|Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Mercer County, New Jersey|Lambertville, New Jersey|Gloucester County, New Jersey|Trenton, New Jersey|New Jersey","-75.9774,39.6853,-74.5237,40.4401",Vector data,Shapefile,https://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/dvrpcgis::long-range-plan-2045-planned-centers-core-cities-neighborhood-centers,https://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/dvrpcgis::county-boundaries-polygon.zip,,https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/portal/rest/services/Planning/LRP_2045_PlanCntrNeigh/FeatureServer/0,,dvrpcgis::long-range-plan-2045-planned-centers-core-cities-neighborhood-centers,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dvrpcgis::long-range-plan-2045-planned-centers-core-cities-neighborhood-centers,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC),04f-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,04f-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,2022-03-27,,Public,False,False,8.5069 MB

,CMP 2019 NPMRDS LOTTR,"A CMP is a systematic process for managing congestion that provides information on transportation system performance. It recommends a range of strategies to minimize congestion and enhance the mobility of people and goods. These multimodal strategies include, but are not limited to, operational improvements, travel demand management, policy approaches, and additions to capacity. The CMP advances the goals of the DVRPCLong-Range Planand strengthens the connection between the Plan and theTransportation Improvement Program (TIP).The CMP, as included in current federal transportation regulations, enhances the existing concept of a Congestion Management System (CMS) with emphasis on being an ongoing cycle and other refinements.

,Bicycle LTS - Low Stress Islands,"Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) is a road classification technique based on the comfort of bicyclists in the traffic stream. One commonly used LTS framework ranges from LTS 1 to LTS 4, classifying road segments that would be comfortable for any bicyclist to segments that only the fearless would brave on a bicycle, respectively. Over the past several years, a variety of papers have been written about different methods for assigning LTS values to road segments and how these LTS values have been used to inform planning and infrastructure decisions through connectivity analysis. Since demand modeling for bicycling is absent from many regional travel demand models (including DVRPC's), a measure of the potential use of a bicycle facility is difficult to obtain. Instead of focusing on demand, bicycle network connectivity is often used as an accessibility metric. Much of the connectivity analysis in prior research compared existing conditions to a ""bike-plan buildout"" scenario, or similar, to compare project merits. This project, instead, provides an example of a different type of LTS and network connectivity application.For detailed information about the data in this layer please goto theDVRPC Bicycle LTS and Connectivity Analysis DocumentationThis layer shows groups of low-stress (LTS 1 and 2) roads that are connected.

Centers provide a focal point in the regional landscape that recognizes the regional and local significance of places, while reinforcing a sense of community for local residents. Centers serve as a basis for organizing and focusing the development landscape and provide a framework for the most efficient provision of supportive infrastructure systems, including water, sewer, and transportation. By concentrating growth around and within Centers, the region can both preserve open space and reduce infrastructure costs.

,New Jersey Urban Boundaries,"NJDOT has revised the New Jersey urban area based upon the 2010 U.S. Census urban area boundaries. The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with a population >= 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters are 2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are >= 50,000. FHWA, however, defines urban areas slightly different. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is >= 5,000, with Small Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas >= 50,000. NJDOT followed the FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular, NJDOT extended outward the urban area (""smoothed"") to the nearest road, stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010 Census urban areas.The urban area update went through a thorough public review and comment period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan planning and organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases of the project to review the updated urban area. All comments were logged into an Urban Area Comment Tracking Form, and an official NJDOT response was provided for each comment.",eng,DVRPC-GIS,Delaware Valley,Datasets,,NewJersey|U.S.CensusBureau|2010Census|UrbanArea|UrbanBoundary|UrbanizedArea|UrbanClusters|SmallUrbanArea|roads|railroads|streams|urban|rural|transportation|NJRoadwayNetwork|politicalboundary.,2022-02-16T19:58:38.000Z,,,"Ardentown, Delaware|Magnolia, Delaware|Little Creek, Delaware|Bowers Beach, Delaware|Ardencroft, Delaware|Bellefonte, Delaware|Arden, Delaware|Kent County, Delaware|New Castle County, Delaware|Frederica, Delaware|Leipsic, Delaware|Delaware|Warren County, New Jersey|Bergen County, New Jersey|Atlantic County, New Jersey|Newark, New Jersey|Margate City, New Jersey|Burlington, New Jersey|Morris County, New Jersey|Northfield, New Jersey|Salem, New Jersey|Clifton, New Jersey|Summit, New Jersey|Paterson, New Jersey|Ocean County, New Jersey|Elizabeth, New Jersey|Plainfield, New Jersey|Camden County, New Jersey|Bordentown, New Jersey|Rahway, New Jersey|Salem County, New Jersey|Englewood, New Jersey|Camden, New Jersey|Gloucester County, New Jersey|Cumberland County, New Jersey|Linden, New Jersey|Passaic County, New Jersey|East Orange, New Jersey|Burlington County, New Jersey|Linwood, New Jersey|Pleasantville, New Jersey|Middlesex County, New Jersey|North Wildwood, New Jersey|City of Orange Township, New Jersey|Brigantine, New Jersey|Corbin City, New Jersey|Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Long Branch, New Jersey|Garfield, New Jersey|Trenton, New Jersey|Hoboken, New Jersey|Jersey City, New Jersey|Wildwood, New Jersey|New Brunswick, New Jersey|Gloucester City, New Jersey|Port Republic, New Jersey|Asbury Park, New Jersey|Ocean City, New Jersey|Vineland, New Jersey|Essex County, New Jersey|Millville, New Jersey|Somerset County, New Jersey|Monmouth County, New Jersey|Absecon, New Jersey|Lambertville, New Jersey|Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Union City, New Jersey|Egg Harbor City, New Jersey|Passaic, New Jersey|Estell Manor, New Jersey|Beverly, New Jersey|Hudson County, New Jersey|Ventnor City, New Jersey|Woodbury, New Jersey|Hackensack, New Jersey|Cape May County, New Jersey|Bridgeton, New Jersey|Union County, New Jersey|Somers Point, New Jersey|Bayonne, New Jersey|Atlantic City, New Jersey|Mercer County, New Jersey|South Amboy, New Jersey|Sea Isle City, New Jersey|New Jersey|Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Chester, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Easton, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania","-75.5412,38.9273,-73.8983,41.2479",Vector data,Shapefile,https://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/dvrpcgis::new-jersey-urban-boundaries,https://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/dvrpcgis::new-jersey-urban-boundaries.zip,,https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/portal/rest/services/Boundaries/UrbanAreas_NJ/FeatureServer/0,,dvrpcgis::new-jersey-urban-boundaries,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dvrpcgis::new-jersey-urban-boundaries,Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC),04f-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,04f-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,2022-03-27,,Public,False,False,1.8805 MB

,Long Range Plan 2050 Pinelands Boundary,"The dataset is an update of a feature class representing four different Pinelands boundaries in Southern New Jersey. It represents the Pinelands Preservation Area District and the Pinelands Protection Area as per the New Jersey Pinelands Protection Act of 1979 (P.L. 1979, Chapter 111, approved June 28, 1979), the Pinelands Comprehensive Management Plan area (N.J.S.A. 13:18A-1 et. seq.), and the Pinelands National Reserve boundary as per the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-625, Sec. 502). Originally the dataset was created manually by interpreting text documents which described the boundary lines and drafting this information onto mylar using USGS photo quads as a base. In 1994, the coverage was digitized and converted to New Jersey State Plane NAD 83 Feet. In 2002, the boundaries were adjusted to a seamless parcel layer. In 2014/15 the boundaries were adjusted to The State of New Jersey Composite of Parcels Data layer developed by the New Jersey Office of Information Technology and an updated Pinelands Management Area layer to make the lines coincidental where applicable. The composite parcel layer is ""In work"", so changes made in the composite parcel layer after the release of this data set will not be reflected in this version. The boundaries are intended to provide reasonable representation of the boundaries for planning purposes. They are not survey grade.

,Wetlands,"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. In addition to updated NWI maps (2015) the Landscape Level Wetland Functional Assessment (LLWFA) has been added to these wetland areas. The Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has been working since 2006 on refining and expanding the use of the LLWFA across much of the state. Each year, EGLE Nonpoint Source Unit is the main entity which distributes 319 watershed planning funds to local units of government, non-profit organizations, and numerous other state, federal, and local partners to reduce nonpoint source pollution statewide. Their yearly prioritization of watershed planning efforts directly influenced the completion of LLWFA efforts, and the scale at which they work is a perfect fit for this landscape level wetland information. This approach addresses both a current (2015) wetland inventory and a Pre-European Settlement inventory, to approximate change over time, and provide the best information possible on wetland status and trends from original condition through today. These watershed planning organizations have utilized these tools to help them better evaluate projects for preserving or enhancing their current wetland resources and planning for restoration of lost resources. Restoring lost wetland functionality shows great promise in addressing the systemic cause of much of the non-point source pollution occurring in the state. The 2015 NWI update is ongoing throughout the state.Detailed Wetland Code Descriptions can be found using the link below. This provides a crosswalk from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) wetlands data, as defined by the Federal Wetland Mapping Standard, to the complete wetland definitions, as defined by the Federal Wetlands Classification Standard. The table can be joined with the NWI wetlands data using the 'Attribute' field. This will provide users with a full wetland or deepwater habitat description for each polygon. https://maps-semcog.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/watershed-code-definitions ",eng,SEMCOG,Southeast Michigan,Datasets,,boundaries|environment|inlandWaters|planningCadastre|environment|inlandWaters|Wetlands|Deepwaterhabitats|Hydrography|Surfacewater|Swamps|marshes|bogs|fens|NWILandscapeLevelWetlandAssessement|LLWFA|land,2022-03-07T23:29:56.000Z,,,"Goodrich, Michigan|New Baltimore, Michigan|Lapeer, Michigan|Royal Oak, Michigan|Ruby, Michigan|Manchester, Michigan|Pontiac, Michigan|Jasper, Michigan|Almont, Michigan|Lakeport, Michigan|Macomb County, Michigan|Ortonville, Michigan|Novi, Michigan|Metamora, Michigan|Dexter, Michigan|Port Huron, Michigan|Grosse Pointe, Michigan|Lenawee County, Michigan|Woodhaven, Michigan|Grand Blanc, Michigan|Rockwood, Michigan|Oak Park, Michigan|South Rockwood, Michigan|Auburn Hills, Michigan|Ferndale, Michigan|Saginaw County, Michigan|Marysville, Michigan|Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan|Bingham Farms, Michigan|Ecorse, Michigan|Leonard, Michigan|Walled Lake, Michigan|Lambertville, Michigan|Rochester, Michigan|South Lyon, Michigan|West Monroe, Michigan|Berkley, Michigan|Eastpointe, Michigan|Madison Heights, Michigan|Livingston County, Michigan|Holly, Michigan|Milford, Michigan|Chelsea, Michigan|Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan|Wayne County, Michigan|Gaines, Michigan|Oakland County, Michigan|Capac, Michigan|Oxford, Michigan|Bancroft, Michigan|Livonia, Michigan|Flushing, Michigan|Durand, Michigan|Rochester Hills, Michigan|Detroit, Michigan|Sterling Heights, Michigan|Blissfield, Michigan|Utica, Michigan|Westland, Michigan|Carleton, Michigan|Lake Fenton, Michigan|Byron, Michigan|Keego Harbor, Michigan|Farmington, Michigan|Yale, Michigan|Flat Rock, Michigan|Deerfield, Michigan|Lathrup Village, Michigan|Fenton, Michigan|St. Clair County, Michigan|Harper Woods, Michigan|Shiawassee County, Michigan|Trenton, Michigan|Whitmore Lake, Michigan|Ida, Michigan|Village Of Clarkston, Michigan|Riverview, Michigan|New Haven, Michigan|Lake Orion, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Taylor, Michigan|Linden, Michigan|Genesee County, Michigan|Garden City, Michigan|River Rouge, Michigan|Center Line, Michigan|New Lothrop, Michigan|Armada, Michigan|Howell, Michigan|Pearl Beach, Michigan|Columbiaville, Michigan|Gibraltar, Michigan|Dundee, Michigan|Emmett, Michigan|Sylvan Lake, Michigan|Franklin, Michigan|Flint, Michigan|Swartz Creek, Michigan|Hartland, Michigan|Birmingham, Michigan|Huntington Woods, Michigan|Wyandotte, Michigan|Dearborn, Michigan|Hazel Park, Michigan|Argentine, Michigan|Adrian, Michigan|Highland Park, Michigan|Saline, Michigan|Barton Hills, Michigan|Davison, Michigan|Southgate, Michigan|Mount Morris, Michigan|Wolverine Lake, Michigan|Burton, Michigan|Northville, Michigan|Brighton, Michigan|Marine City, Michigan|Vernon, Michigan|Corunna, Michigan|Southfield, Michigan|Ann Arbor, Michigan|Middletown, Michigan|Petersburg, Michigan|Beverly Hills, Michigan|Britton, Michigan|Milan, Michigan|Lennon, Michigan|Lincoln Park, Michigan|Estral Beach, Michigan|Orchard Lake Village, Michigan|Clawson, Michigan|Village Of Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan|Plymouth, Michigan|Beecher, Michigan|Oakley, Michigan|Wixom, Michigan|Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan|Lapeer County, Michigan|Temperance, Michigan|Pleasant Ridge, Michigan|Stony Point, Michigan|Inkster, Michigan|Richmond, Michigan|Dryden, Michigan|Pinckney, Michigan|Imlay City, Michigan|Hamtramck, Michigan|Roseville, Michigan|Fraser, Michigan|Ypsilanti, Michigan|Maybee, Michigan|Belleville, Michigan|Detroit Beach, Michigan|Romeo, Michigan|Mount Clemens, Michigan|Algonac, Michigan|Warren, Michigan|Troy, Michigan|Wayne, Michigan|Tecumseh, Michigan|Melvindale, Michigan|St. Clair, Michigan|Monroe, Michigan|Woodland Beach, Michigan|Monroe County, Michigan|Dearborn Heights, Michigan|Fowlerville, Michigan|South Monroe, Michigan|St. Clair Shores, Michigan|Luna Pier, Michigan|Washtenaw County, Michigan|Lake Angelus, Michigan|Allen Park, Michigan|Farmington Hills, Michigan|Clinton, Michigan|Memphis, Michigan|Romulus, Michigan|Attica, Michigan|Michigan","-84.1946,41.7237,-82.2879,43.1718",Vector data,Shapefile,https://maps-semcog.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SEMCOG::wetlands,https://maps-semcog.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SEMCOG::wetlands.zip,,https://services1.arcgis.com/xUx8EjNc6egUPYWh/arcgis/rest/services/Wetlands/FeatureServer/35,,SEMCOG::wetlands,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/SEMCOG::wetlands,SEMCOG Open Data,06f-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,06f-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,2022-03-27,,Public,False,False,138.0231 MB
