23ab9309817f4832810937c8a16239d1_0,04a-01,MDOT SHA NPDES Conveyance,,"BackgroundAs a government agency that owns and maintains separate storm sewer systems, the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) is mandated to file a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). The permit requires the inventory, inspection, and maintenance of SHA stormwater infrastructure. SHA is responsible for maintaining storm drain infrastructure on more than 5,000 miles of roadway statewide. SHA has developed a program consisting of SHA personnel, data managers, and subject matter experts to support the permit requirements and maintain these roadways. The tasks involved in the SHA NPDES data collection program are often completed by engineering consultants for SHA.The data are organized into a series of drainage systems with stormwater management facilities that are interconnected, allowing for flow-tracing function through distinct systems. A drainage system is defined as a series of storm drain structures or point features (i.e., manholes, inlets, endwalls) that connect hydraulically through conveyance features such as pipes and / or ditches. Closed and open storm drain structures are connected by pipe and ditch conveyance to create the drainage system. Stormwater management facilities (SWMF), also known as stormwater best management practices (BMP) are inventoried with the storm drain system. A system can include both open and closed storm drain features.ConveyanceConveyance features to be identified and inventoried include actual, physical features (pipes and ditches) and database connectivity features (hydraulic connectors). Conveyance is represented as line features in the database. Although they do not physically exist, hydraulic connectors should be inventoried to facilitate connection of drainage systems through stormwater BMPs; this is the only case where a hydraulic connector is created. Not every pipe or ditch conveyance is inventoried, but generally all conveyances between structures are inventoried. Conveyance features will have an upstream and downstream structure. When contract plans are not available showing proper conveyance for a storm drain system, conveyance can be determined by looking at the pipe(s) direction inside of structures. Field crews are not required to open manhole lids, and conveyance can be assumed at the field crew?s discretion when plans are not available.Pipes, Cross Culverts,  Driveway CulvertsPipes?connect structures together in a system to maintain conveyance. Pipes consist of closed storm drain pipes, cross culverts, and driveway culverts. Rules for collecting cross culvert and driveway culvert pipes are described below. The following are rules that should be followed when collecting pipes within the storm drain network:All pipes between closed storm drain structures are inventoried.Pipes less than five feet in height are inventoried within SHA ROW.Pipes that are greater than five feet in height are not inventoried if they do not connect to closed storm drain structures.?Pipes that are greater than five feet in height and do connect to closed storm drain structures are inventoried with the storm drain network.Closed storm drain systems that outfall through a pipe or culvert that is greater than five feet in height are inventoried.?Pipe size, shape, invert, and material are recorded for all pipes. Because field crews are not required to open grates or manhole lids, this attribute information is most often gathered from contract plans. Pipe sizes and material should be verified in the field by observation through inlet grates and at end structures (headwalls, end sections, outfalls, projection pipes). Field crews should become familiar with different pipe sizes and materials prior to conducting field inventory.Cross Culverts?are pipes, boxes, or arches that convey water from one side of the ROW to the other side, usually under the roadway. Cross culverts are inventoried as pipes. Depending on the situation and culvert size, not all cross culverts will be inventoried. The following are rules that should be followed when collecting cross culverts:The culvert height is determined from contract plans when available. Otherwise care should be taken to measure and estimate the actual culvert height in the field. This may require estimating the depth of sedimentation at the culvert ends to determine the feet of buried culvert.Culverts that are less than five feet in height are inventoried.Culverts that are greater than five feet in height are not inventoried.A culvert that is greater than five feet in height that has a closed storm drain tying in is not inventoried. Instead, the most downstream structure in the closed storm drain system is inventoried as a pipe connection at the location the storm drain system connects to the culvert.Driveway Culverts?and entrance culverts are pipes, possibly with an end structure, that conveys water under driveways, utility access roads, or stormwater BMP access roads. Not all driveway culverts will be inventoried within SHA ROW. The following are rules that should be followed when collection driveway culverts:Private driveway culverts and culverts at farm or other access points that do not require access permits should not be inventoried. Culverts under entrance drives that provide two-way or greater traffic such as multi-family residential, commercial, public, or industrial properties are inventoried. Culverts under SHA-owned stormwater maintenance access or other utility access roads should also be inventoried.If the private driveway or access drive culvert has a closed storm drain structure such as an inlet or riser on the upstream or downstream end of the pipe, then the culvert should be inventoried.If a driveway culvert is excluded from the inventory, other adjoining closed drain structures completing the system should be connected using a ditch. The ditch in this case should be drawn through the culverts as if the culvert does not exist.DitchesDitches and open conveyance are channels or flow paths that connect open structures (headwalls, end sections, endwalls, projection pipes, inlets with open backs) in a system to maintain the conveyance. Attributes collected for ditches include material (vegetative, concrete, riprap, etc.), bottom width, and side slope. Not all ditches or open channels within SHA ROW are to be inventoried in the geodatabase. Ditches to be inventoried are the following:Ditches or open conveyance between open structures.Ditches or open conveyance greater than two feet in bottom width.Ditches or open conveyance that flow into stormwater BMPs regardless of bottom width.Hydraulic ConnectorsHydraulic Connectors connect the outfalls into stormwater BMPs to the control structure of the stormwater BMP to maintain conveyance through the system. Hydraulic connectors are used to represent connectivity through a stormwater BMP from inflows to control structures. Inflow points and control structures for stormwater BMPs should be connected with a hydraulic connector, including infiltration trenches. If hydraulic connectors do not exist in the previous inventory, the current development should create them. The hydraulic connector line features are stored in the CONVEYANCE feature class and no additional attribute information is collected. The connector is use so that connectivity between structures is maintained through stormwater BMPs and network tracing can occur.SimplificationsThe simplification process flattens database tables that normalize attribute information, resulting in a dataset with all attributes but also many null fields when the attribute type is not relevant to the SWMFAC type. The simplified data are a snapshot in time of the production NPDES data, updated every night.PublishingThis service was last published by Elliott Plack on 9/6/2019 based on a materialized view created by John Shiu.

Data can also be exported for offline workflows. Please cite the Census and ACS when using this data.Data Note from the Census:Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see?Accuracy of the Data).? The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This dataset is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year. The service contains the ACS data as of the current vintage listed. Tabular data is updated annually with the Census Bureau's release schedule. This may alter data values, fields, and boundaries.?Click here?to learn more about ACS data releases.Boundaries come from the?US Census TIGER geodatabases. Boundaries are updated at the same time as the data updates (annually), and the boundary vintage appropriately matches the data vintage?as specified by the Census. These are Census boundaries with water and/or coastlines clipped for cartographic purposes. For census tracts, the water cutouts are derived from a subset of the 2010 AWATER (Area Water) boundaries offered by TIGER. For state and county boundaries, the water and coastlines are derived from the coastlines of the 500k?TIGER Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles.

This permit is called a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. NPDES permits regulate wastewater discharges by limiting the quantities of pollutants to be discharged and imposing monitoring requirements and other conditions. The limits and/or requirements in the permit help ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality Standards and Federal Regulations, all of which were written to protect public health and the aquatic environment. Pollutants are broadly defined as any type of industrial, municipal or agricultural wastewater.?An individual NPDES permit is unique to each facility.

The Livable Landscapes map is divided into two core areas, growth areas and rural resource areas, as prescribed by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The growth areas consist of the urban landscape and the suburban landscape. The rural resource areas consist of the agricultural landscape and the rural landscape. The natural landscape exists throughout the county recognizing the important network of natural resources needing specific protection. Livable landscapes recognizes the diversity that makes Chester County a special place. Each landscape has a different character and is appropriate for different intensities and varieties of development. The urban and suburban landscapes can best accommodate future growth. The county will encourage future development to be concentrated in these landscapes. The rural and agricultural landscapes are least appropriate for intense growth.

In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the urban footprint. There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.How should this data set be cited???

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

This layer also includes stormwater storage structures that predate NPDES requirements.Common Types of BMPsBioretention, Bioswale, Rain Garden?- Bioretention BMPs, including bioswales (vegetated swales), and rain gardens, utilize landscaped areas of plants that control water quality and quantity. Bioretention areas are typically used as islands in parking lots to provide vegetation to absorb runoff. These areas typically include underdrains.Detention Pond (Dry)?- A dry pond or detention basin is a depression used to temporarily store stormwater. It has no permanent pool.Exfiltration Basin or Trench?- Exfiltration areas capture and redirect stormwater runoff.?Green Parking or Roof?- Green parking lots and roofs use natural vegetation to absorb stormwater runoff from traditionally?impermeable?surfaces. Green roofs are typically layered, with an underlying structural component and the green component on top to manage runoff.Infiltration Basin or Trench?- Infiltration areas capture and temporarily store stormwater before allowing it to enter the soil. By slowing the release of water, pollutants are removed by underlying processes.In-Line Storage and Underground Detention?- An underground detention system consists a series of special storage chambers to temporarily hold stormwater. In-line storage may use similar chambers or larger-than-necessary pipes to temporarily store stormwater as part of the pipe network.Oil-Water Separator?- A?device?used to separate oil and other suspended solids from wastewater.Permeable/Porous Pavement?- Any pavement that allows stormwater runoff to filter through the surface into an underlying storage or infiltration area. These areas typically also utilize underdrains.Retention Pond (Wet)?- A retention pond or wet detention pond is a depression with a permanent pool that can store additional runoff during stormwater events.Sand/Organic Filter or Vegetated Filter Strip?- Any area that uses sand, vegetation, or other organic material to catch large particle pollutants before they enter waterways.?Stormwater Wetland?- A stormwater wetland uses a combination of pools and complex native vegetation to store surface water runoff in a manner that mimics natural processes.?",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2019-04-03T12:50:18.000Z,,,"Stark County, Ohio|Ohio","-81.5405,40.6902,-81.2057,40.9735",Ohio State,"Stark County, Ohio",Stark County Ohio,http://opendata.starkcountyohio.gov/datasets/fd3e93a0fc624f8d8e45920c9e30dc41_0,http://opendata.starkcountyohio.gov/datasets/fd3e93a0fc624f8d8e45920c9e30dc41_0.zip,https://utility.arcgis.com/usrsvcs/servers/fd3e93a0fc624f8d8e45920c9e30dc41/rest/services/Engineer/StormwaterPostConstructionBMPs/MapServer/0,,MapServer,Stark County|Ohio|SCGIS|Stormwater|MS4|Drainage|Infrastructure|NPDES|Inspections|Environmental

This layer was originally downloaded in May, 2019, from?https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Data-Download.html?and clipped to the Stark County boundary.?This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands_Project_Metadata layer, which contains project specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project boundaries.",Geospatial data,,Shapefile,Dataset|Service,Vector,2019-05-30T14:41:26.000Z,,,"Stark County, Ohio|Ohio","-81.6513,40.6291,-81.082,40.9934",Ohio State,"Stark County, Ohio",Stark County Ohio,http://opendata.starkcountyohio.gov/datasets/7d3416bafe814ccd986383c73386a2b7_0,http://opendata.starkcountyohio.gov/datasets/7d3416bafe814ccd986383c73386a2b7_0.zip,https://services2.arcgis.com/1JiK2PayqrHvvJhM/arcgis/rest/services/NationalWetlandsInventory/FeatureServer/0,,FeatureServer,Stark County|Ohio|SCGIS|Wetlands|Environmental|Water|Conservation
