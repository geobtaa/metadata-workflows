,Traffic Stops,"In 2016, Saint Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell released 15 years of traffic stop data that hadn't previously been made public. Since then, the department has continued to release data about who is being stopped, where the stops are occurring and why officers are making the stops.2021 Data: At a glanceOfficers made 16,703 traffic stops12,702 traffic stops were made for moving violations3,342 traffic stops were made for equipment violations649 investigative traffic stops were made9 traffic stops were the result of 911 calls1 stop was made for other reasons.Traffic stops: an important public safety toolMost traffic stops occur in areas of the city from which the most 911 calls are madeMost traffic stops occur in neighborhoods experiencing the highest levels of violent crimeOfficers are most likely to issue citations for behavior that leads to crashes, injuries and deathTraffic stops help officers take illegally possessed guns off the streets—in 2021, 150 illegally possessed guns were recovered during traffic stops.Chief Axtell's commitment to responsiveness and transparency with our community led to changes in 2021 for traffic stop protocols of the Saint Paul Police Department.On Sept. 8, 2021, Chief Axtell convened a Traffic Stop Working Group to explore overall traffic safety in the City of Saint Paul, equity and traffic enforcement—and then make recommendations about how the SPPD can best keep the streets safe for everyone.The group included members of the Saint Paul NAACP, the African American Leadership Council, the Black Ministerial Alliance, the City's Department of Human Rights & Equal Economic Opportunity, the City Attorney's Office, traffic safety advocates and Saint Paul police officers.After months of data review and analysis, the group determined that the following driving behaviors and violations are most likely to lead to crashes, injuries and death:speedingdistracted drivingreckless drivingdriving under the influencerunning stop signs and stop lights andegregious equipment violations such as driving without headlights, significantly obstructed view, etc.Through the workgroup and data analysis, the conclusion was reached that, while minor equipment violations (including expired tabs, a single burned out headlight or taillight, small windshield cracks, lack of license plate lights, and small objects hanging from mirrors that don't significantly obstruct a driver's view of the road) are illegal and important to note, they have little effect on the overall safety of our streets.As a result, Chief Axtell provided guidance and direction to officers that minor equipment violations should not be used as a primary reason for a traffic stop, unless there is an articulable public safety concern. In addition, SPPD began working to establish a system to allow officers to document minor equipment violations and notify the registered owners of vehicles via the mail.Where Traffic Stops Occur: Keeping streets and neighborhoods safeThe 2021 data show that officers make most traffic stops in neighborhoods experiencing higher levels of serious crime and where community members have shared concerns about speeding, distracted driving and other dangerous behaviors.

The River Corridor Overlay District and its subclassifications, RC1, RC2, RC3, RC4, are map overlay districts, designed to provide comprehensive floodplain and river bluff management for the city in accordance with the policies of Minnesota Statutes (Chapters 103 and 116G), Minnesota Regulations (MEQC 54) and Governor's Executive Order No. 79-19.The MRCCA is a land corridor along the Mississippi River in the seven-county metro area in which special land use regulations guide development activity. The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances.The MRCCA is home to a full range of residential neighborhoods and parks, as well as river-related commerce, industry, and transportation.

,District Councils,"Saint Paul has had a formal structure of neighborhood organizations to engage residents and collaborate with city government since 1975--one of the first in the nation.These organizations are known as district councils because they are resident groups thatengage and represent the people living in one of the city's 17 planning districts.Each district council is a 501(c)(3) non-profitwith a voluntary board of directors composed of members elected by their neighbors. The district council structure was formed as part of the development of the city's Citizen Participation Program, now known as the Community Engagement Program. The purpose of this program is to create opportunities for residents to learn about what is happening in their neighborhoods and collaborate with one another and city government to maintain and improve the quality of life in neighborhoods. The program includes funding allocated to each district council on a formula basis, technical assistance from city planners and other city staff regarding issues that are important to the neighborhood and non-profit management assistance from the city's Community Engagement Coordinator.District councils each are involved in work to improve the physical, social and economic structures in their neighborhood. The activity common to all district councils is the development of adistrict plan (sometimes referred to as a neighborhood plan) that is reviewed by the Planning Commission, CityCouncil and the Metropolitan Council--the region'smetropolitanplanning organization--before being adopted as part of the city's Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan is a key tool used by the city to guide law-making and budgeting. District plans are an opportunity for residents to influence how those laws and budgets impact their neighborhoods. Along with this critical planning work,district councils may also be involved in:Reviewing community development proposalsAdvocating for park andrecreation center improvementsCoordinating community gardens and neighborhood beautification projectsPromoting environmental action through volunteering and advocacyOrganizing block clubs and working with the police department and other city agencies to improve public safetyDistrict councils rely on community-building activities and events as the basis for convening residents to become involved in their neighborhood. These include neighborhood forums, festivals, parades and block parties.A commitment to equity is foundational to successful community engagement. In 2017, the district councils proposed a change to the Community Engagement Program's Innovation Fund that was adopted in 2018. The fund is now divided equally among the 17 district councils to promote equitable practices and neighborhood outcomes. The goals of this program are:District council staff and volunteers more accurately reflect the communities they serve.District councils review and adopt policies and practices that intentionally create space for residents who are currently under-represented.District councils pursue systemic work that reflects the needs and priorities of residents who have been historically under-represented.Additionally, district council staff are required to participate in a peer support/best practices network composed of district councils or similar grassroots, place-based organizations in the region.",English,Saint Paul GIS,"City of Saint Paul, Minnesota",Geospatial data,2022-04-05T15:04:54.000Z,,,,"Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States|Minnesota, United States",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://information.stpaul.gov/maps/stpaul::district-councils,,item.html?id=1228fa76fd4a4d9ca501f22a7178e302&sublayer=0,Minnesota,05c-02,05c-02_84,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,

,Police Sentiment Scores,"This dataset was used by Chicago Police Department analysts to create the publicly available ""Chicago Police Sentiment Dashboard"" (https://home.chicagopolice.org/statistics-data/data-dashboards/sentiment-dashboard/). This online dashboard displays information related to how safe Chicago residents feel and how much trust they have in the police. The dashboard and this dataset are updated monthly and users are able to view data citywide, as well as within the five detective areas and in each of the 22 districts. Users can sort this data based on year, month and location. Information is also available based on demographics, including age, sex, race, education and income level. The dashboard is meant to improve transparency as well as work toward compliance with the consent decree. The first five columns indicate the type of organizational unit described by the records and which particular unit. Subsequent columns show either a safety or trust score for a demographic group. Scores are derived from responses to survey questions, with each response being a value that ranges from 0-10. Please note that Elucd trust and safety scores are NOT a percentage. A score of 65 means that average response to the questions is 6.5 out of 10. The final two columns show the time period in which the data were collected. The dataset was created by our partner, Elucd (https://elucd.com), through delivering short surveys to Chicago residents through digital ads. See [https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard_FAQ_11_25_20.pdf] for more information on the project.

,COVID-19 Daily Vaccinations - Chicago Residents,"COVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on home address, as reported by medical providers in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). I-CARE includes doses administered in Illinois and some doses administered outside of Illinois and reported in I-CARE by Illinois providers. Definitions: People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received. People with a booster dose: Number of people who have a completed vaccine series and have received at least one additional dose. This includes people who received a booster dose and immunocompromised people who received an additional primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Total doses administered: Number of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered. Daily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, number of people who have a completed vaccine series, and number of people with a booster dose. Cumulative totals are also provided for each measure as of that date. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered. Coverage percentages for the City of Chicago are calculated based on cumulative number of people with that vaccination status. Daily totals of all doses, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, number of people who have completed a vaccine series, and number of people with a booster dose are shown by age group, gender, and race/ethnicity. Denominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2019 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2019 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa). The Chicago Department of Health (CDPH) uses the most complete data available to estimate COVID-19 vaccination coverage among Chicagoans, but there are several limitations that impact our estimates. Data reported in I-CARE only include doses administered in Illinois and some doses administered outside of Illinois reported historically by Illinois providers. Doses administered by federal agencies, like the Veterans Health Administration, are also not currently reported in I-CARE. Due to people receiving vaccinations that are not recorded in I-CARE that can be linked to their record, such as someone receiving a vaccine dose in another state, the number of people with a completed series or a booster dose is underestimated. Inconsistencies in records of separate doses administered to the same person, such as slight variations in dates of birth, can result in duplicate first dose records for a person and overestimate of the number of people with at least one dose and underestimate the number of people with a completed series or booster dose. All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH. Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined. For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

,COVID-19 Vaccinations by Age and Race-Ethnicity,"COVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on the reported race-ethnicity and age group of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). Vaccination Status Definitions: People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received. People with at least one booster dose: Number of people who have a completed vaccine series and have received at least one additional dose. This includes people who received a booster dose and immunocompromised people who received an additional primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Eligibility and recommendations vary by age and type of primary vaccine series received. Weekly cumulative totals by vaccination status are shown for each combination of race-ethnicity and age group. Note that each age group has a row where race-ethnicity is ""All"" so care should be taken when summing rows. Vaccinations are counted based on the date on which they were administered. Weekly cumulative totals are reported from the week ending Saturday, December 19, 2020 onward (after December 15, when vaccines were first administered in Chicago) through the Saturday prior to the dataset being updated. Population counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 2019 1-year estimates. For some of the age groups by which COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized in the United States, race-ethnicity distributions were specifically reported in the ACS estimates. For others, race-ethnicity distributions were estimated by the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) by weighting the available race-ethnicity distributions, using proportions of constituent age groups. Coverage percentages are calculated based on the cumulative number of people in each population subgroup (age group by race-ethnicity) who have each vaccination status as of the date, divided by the estimated number of Chicago residents in each subgroup. Actual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in small race-ethnicity subgroups of each age group. All coverage percentages are capped at 99%. All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH. Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.

,Violence Reduction - Shotspotter Alerts,"This dataset contains all ShotSpotter alerts since the introduction of ShotSpotter to some Chicago Police Department (CPD) districts in 2017. ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system designed to automatically determine the location of potential outdoor gunfire. ShotSpotter audio sensors are placed in several CPD districts throughout the city (specific districts are noted below). If at least three sensors detect a sound that the ShotSpotter software determines to be potential gunfire, a location is determined and the alert is sent to human ShotSpotter analysts for review. Either the alert is sent to CPD, or it is dismissed. Each alert can contain multiple rounds of gunfire; sometimes there are multiple alerts for what may be determined to be one incident. More detail on the technology and its accuracy can be found on the company's website here. It should also be noted that ShotSpotter alerts may increase year-over-year while gun violence did not necessarily increase accordingly because of improvements in detection sensors. ShotSpotter does not exist in every CPD district, and it was not rolled out in every district at the same time. ShotSpotter was first deployed in Chicago in 2017, and sensors exist in the following districts as of the May 2021 launch of this dataset: 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 015, and 025.",English,data.cityofchicago.org,"City of Chicago, Illinois",Geospatial data,9/23/21,,,,"Chicago, Illinois, United States|Illinois, United States",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/3h7q-7mdb,,3h7q-7mdb,Chicago,12c-01,12c-01_10,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,

Daily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, first dose, and second dose, as well as cumulative totals as of that date. Initial vaccines required two doses of vaccine to be administered over a period of time specific to each vaccine brand. At least one future vaccine only required one dose to be considered fully vaccinated. While these doses completed the series, additional doses have been approved for some situations and are included in the Total Doses columns. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered. All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH. Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.

,COVID-19 Vaccinations by ZIP Code,"NOTE, 11/4/2021: With the authorization of vaccine for children age 5-11, we have added three columns to this dataset. For each grouping of columns (Total, 1st Dose, and Series Completed), there is now a 5+ column. Care should be taken when summing values to avoid accidental double-counting. COVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on the home ZIP Code of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). The ZIP Code where a person lives is not necessarily the same ZIP Code where the vaccine was administered. Definitions: People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received. Total doses administered: Number of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered. Daily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, and number of people who have a completed vaccine series. Cumulative totals for each measure as of that date are also provided. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered. Coverage percentages are calculated based on cumulative number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose and cumulative number of people who have a completed vaccine series in each ZIP Code. Population counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2015-2019 5-year estimates and can be seen in the ZIP Code, 2019 rows of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa). Actual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in areas with small population sizes. Additionally, the medical provider may report a work address or incorrect home address for the person receiving the vaccination which may lead to over or under estimates of vaccination coverage by geography.

This dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report in support of a consent decree executed between the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (OAG) and the City of Chicago. The CPD is currently engaged in a reform process, as governed by that consent decree. A consent decree is a written settlement resolving a legal dispute. The OAG/City of Chicago consent decree includes detailed requirements organized into 11 core areas (e.g., use of force, accountability and transparency), collectively designed to create organizational change within CPD. To review the consent decree and learn more about the process, see the City of Chicago's police reform webpage: https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.html This dataset is made available to the public pursuant to consent decree requirements described in Paragraph 79 and Paragraph 80. Paragraph 79 of the consent decree states that: By April 1, 2020, and every year thereafter, CPD will conduct an assessment of the relative frequency of all misdemeanor arrests and administrative notices of violation (""ANOVs"") effectuated by CPD members of persons in specific demographic categories, including race and gender. Then, the last sentence of Paragraph 80 states that: Upon completion of the assessment, CPD will publish the underlying data, excluding personal identifying information (e.g., name, address, contact information), via a publicly-accessible, web-based data platform. This dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report pursuant to Paragraph 79. The report was designed to achieve compliance with Paragraph 79. Each record in the dataset shows information about an ANOV issued by a CPD member. An ANOV is a citation issued for violating a Municipal Code of Chicago ordinance. ANOV's are adjudicated by the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH). ANOV data are owned and housed by the Department of Administrative Hearings. CPD receives a daily data extraction from the DOAH data system, whereupon ANOV data is ingested into the CPD data system. To request the aforementioned report contact the CPD Freedom of Information Act Section at https://home.chicagopolice.org/information/freedom-of-information-act-foia.. NOV NUMBER is the record identifier for the dataset. Each record in the dataset is a unique, unduplicated citation. Users interested in learning more about how CPD handles ANOV citations can review the current policy, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

,Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated,"This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January - March, April - June, July - September, October - December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations. This dataset includes a "" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I "" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (""Y""), No (""N""), or Unknown (""UKNOWN."") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the ""shooting"" column will read either ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as ""Y."" Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with ""UNKNOWN"" in the shooting column. The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information. How does this dataset classify victims? The methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type: Homicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. To determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. For a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery.

,Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings,"This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data).

Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with ""UNKNOWN"" in the shooting column. Each row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim—if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent.

As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises.

,Traffic Crashes - Vision Zero Chicago Traffic Fatalities,"Traffic fatalities within the City of Chicago that are included in Vision Zero Chicago (VZC) statistics. Vision Zero is Chicago's commitment to eliminating fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes. The VZC Traffic Fatality List is compiled by the City's multi-departmental Fatal Crash Response Coordination Committee (FCRCC) that reviews fatal traffic crashes provided by Chicago Police Department's Major Accident Investigation Unit (MAIU). The dataset is updated after the FCRCC meetings in the 4th week of the month. Thus, the fatality list for a particular month will be available in the dataset after the 4th week of the following month. This committee uses a standardized process - sometimes differing from other sources and everyday use of the term -- to determine whether a death is a ""traffic fatality"" for VZC purposes. Therefore, the traffic fatalities included in this list may differ from the fatal crashes reported in the full Traffic Crashes dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85ca-t3if). Official traffic crash data are published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) on a yearly basis. The traffic fatality list determined on an ongoing basis through the year may differ from IDOT's official crash data for Chicago as IDOT may define the cause and location differently from the FCRCC. Once IDOT publishes its data for a year, crashes in this dataset for that year are edited to match IDOT's determinations, unless the FCRCC disagrees with the IDOT determination - which happens only rarely and usually due to an interpretation of one of the criteria below. VZC Traffic Fatalities can be linked with other traffic crash datasets using the ""RD_NO"" or ""Person_ID"" fields. The FCRCC defines a ""traffic fatality"" for the purpose of VZC statistics as ""any death caused by a traffic crash, within 30 days of the crash"" and ""involves a motor vehicle."" Fatalities that meet the VZC definition of a traffic fatality are included in this dataset unless excluded by the criteria below. There may be records in this dataset that do not appear as fatalities in the other datasets. The following criteria exclude a death from being considered a ""traffic fatality"" for VZC purposes: 1. The Medical Examiner determined that the primary cause of the fatality was not the traffic crash, including: a. The fatality was reported as a suicide based on a police investigation. b. The fatality was reported as a homicide in which the ""party at fault"" intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm that caused the victim's death. c. The fatality was caused directly and exclusively by a medical condition or where the fatality was not attributable to road user movement on a public roadway. (Note: If a person driving suffers a medical emergency and consequently hit and kills another road user, the other road user is included although the driver suffering a medical emergency is excluded.) 2. The crash did not occur within the public right-of-way. 3. The crash involved a train or such mode of transport within their dedicated right-of-way. 4. The fatality was on a roadway not under Chicago Police Department jurisdiction, including: a. The fatality was occurred on an expressway. The City of Chicago does not have oversight on the expressway system. However, a fatality on expressway ramps occurring within the City jurisdiction will be counted in Vision Zero Chicago Traffic Fatalities. b. The fatality occurred outside City limits. Crashes on streets along the City boundary may be assigned to another jurisdiction after the investigation if it is determined that the crash started or substantially occurred on the side of the street that is outside the City limits. Jurisdiction of streets along the City boundary are split between City and neighboring jurisdictions along the street center line. 5.

This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/reopening-chicago.html#reopeningmetrics. For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19. The National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments, and academic and private sector partners, is used to capture information during an Emergency Department (ED) visit. ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. This dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. This dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases. This dataset originally contained only CLI columns. In June 2021, the diagnosis columns were added, back filled to the start of the pandemic but with the caveat noted above. Roughly simultaneously, updating of the CLI columns was discontinued, although previously existing data were kept. Reflecting the new columns, the name of the dataset was changed from ""COVID-Like Illness (CLI) Emergency Department Visits"" to ""COVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits"" at the same time.

,Chicago COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI),"The Chicago CCVI identifies communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and are vulnerable to barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

The 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score. The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area. ZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. The COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index. ZIP Codes are based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

,"City of Cincinnati, Ohio Resident Survey","The Cincinnati Community Perceptions Survey was developed by the City's Office of Performance and Data Analytics and ETC Institute in the fall of 2021. This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years. The survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population. This year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.

,"Fast Food Outlet Density per 1,000 Residents","The Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) obtained the food permit list from the Baltimore City Health Department in August 2011, which includes all sites that sell food, such as stores, restaurants and temporary locations such as farmers' market stands and street carts. The restaurants were grouped into three categories, including full service restaurants, fast food chains and carryouts. Carryout and fast food chain restaurants were extracted from the restaurant layer and spatially joined with the 2010 Community Statistical Area (CSA) data layer, provided by BNIA-JFI. The prepared foods density, per 1,000 people, was calculated for each CSA using the CSA's population and the total number of carryout and fast food restaurants, including vendors selling prepared foods in public markets, in each CSA.

,Tax Lien Certificate Sale Properties,"Note: The date of the 2022 tax sale has been moved from May 16, 2022 to June 27, 2022.The City of Baltimore holds an annual tax lien certificate sale. The tax sale is used to collect delinquent real property taxes and other unpaid charges owed to the City, all of which are liens against the real property. It is a public, online auction of City lien interests on properties. The highest bidder in the auction pays the total amount of the property liens to the City and receives a tax sale certificate from the City which gives the bidder the right to obtain ownership of the property by filing a tax sale foreclosure lawsuit. The owner of the property can prevent the highest bidder from obtaining ownership by ""redeeming"" the property. Redemption requires the owner or an interested party, such as a mortgage holder, to reimburse the successful bidder for the amount of liens and other charges paid to the City, as well as the bidder's interest and other fees and costs set by law.If a property has not been redeemed from tax sale, the ""REDEMPTION DATE"" field will be blank.

,Baltimore City Qualified Census Tracts,"The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) designates Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) for purposes of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. The LIHTC program is defined in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The LIHTC is a tax incentive intended to increase the availability of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC statute provides two criteria for QCT eligibility. A census tract must have either: 1) a poverty rate of at least 25 percent; or 2) 50 percent or more of its householders must have incomes below 60 percent of the area median household income. The area corresponds to a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan area. Further, the LIHTC statute requires that no more than 20 percent of the metropolitan area population reside within designated QCTs (This limit also applies collectively to the nonmetropolitan counties in each state). Thus, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT. With respect to the census tracts, the Census Bureau defines them in cooperation with local authorities every ten years for the purposes of the decennial census and, following a public comment period, has recently completed defining tract boundaries for the 2010 Census. Note that when census tract boundaries are set, they remain unchanged for the next decade. Thus, tract boundaries will not be changed until the 2020 Decennial Census.Change Log2022-2-15:- Added FY2022 data- Metadata added- Columns renamed to a standard format- Agency names reformatted with Workday conventionsData Dictionaryfield_namedescriptiondata_typerange_of_possible_valuesexample_valuessearchableCensus_Tract_2010The ID of the US census tract from 2010 Census results.

,911 Behavioral Health  Diversion,"On June 16, 2021, the City of Baltimore launched a 911 Diversion Pilot in collaboration with a community-based service provider, Baltimore Crisis Response, Inc. (BCRI), to divert two behavioral health call types to start: PSYCH ALERT (non-suicidal and alert) and SUIC ALERT (suicidal and alert).The central mission of the 911 Behavioral Health Diversion project is to match individuals to the most appropriate and available resource. Individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis will be connected to a crisis hotline staffed 24/7 by trained mental health professionals. Co-response occurs when patients are connected to the crisis line and there is some degree of response by BPD or BCFD resources. Although the 911 Diversion Pilot is an immediate step, the City intends to expand 911 diversion beyond behavioral health responses - such as considering improved use of peer supports, housing opportunities, and community-based youth diversion.Data Dictionary field_name description data_type range_of_possible_values example_values callDateTime Date and time of 911 call Date 9/26/2021 17:14 responseType Diversion: Incident involved BCRI AND BPD nor BCFD were involved (BCFD disposition of ""cancelled"" still counts as diversion) Co-notification: incident involved BCRI AND BPD and/or BCFD also involved (at least two agencies involved, may be all three) AND call was not returned to dispatch from BCRI (i.e. an escalated diversion) Escalated Diversion: Incident involved BCRI AND Call was transferred back to 911, BCFD or BPD response was requested Unable to Divert: (there was intent to involve BCRI but something prevented a clean diversion or co-notification.)

The map also includes a reference layer.Content meant to provide spatial context (the basemap) should recede in visual priority, helping to establish the thematic layers that they support (rather than compete with them). There are many ways to sufficiently mute your basemap, but for satellite imagery, de-saturation is a nice option. An image that is all or mostly black and white won't compete as much with the brightly colored thematic data that it supports.

,Re: Visualizing Black America,"Famed sociologist, writer, and Black rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois fundamentally changed the representation of Black Americans with his exhibition of data visualizations at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Beautiful in design and powerful in content, these data portraits make visible a wide spectrum of African American culture, from advances in education to the lingering effects of slavery. They convey a literal and figurative representation of what he famously referred to as the color line. The plates were collected in the book W.E.B. Du Bois Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America. To celebrate Black History Month in February of 2022, the Baltimore Mayor's Office of Performance and Innovation (OPI) teamed up with other City analysts to build a library of data visualizations inspired by W.E.B. Du Bois.
