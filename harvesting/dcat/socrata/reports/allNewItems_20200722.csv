,Arrests,"Each record in this dataset shows information about an arrest executed by the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide. A more detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email dataportal@cityofchicago.org. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. The data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). Department members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. Each record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's ""Contains"" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns. Users interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/). Relevant directives include: 	Special Order S06-01-11 - CLEAR Automated Arrest System: describes the application used by Department members to enter arrest data. 	Special Order S06-01-04 - Arrestee Identification Process: describes processes related to obtaining and using CB numbers. 	Special Order S09-03-04 - Assignment and Processing of Records Division Numbers: describes processes related to obtaining and using RD numbers.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19. This dataset is a companion to the COVID-19 Daily Cases and Deaths dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/naz8-j4nc). The major difference in this dataset is that the cases, deaths, and corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers. The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data. All rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for ""Total"" columns. Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider. Confirmed cases are counted on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths are those occurring among confirmed cases based on the day of death. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers and is not verified by CDPH. Denominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa). All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects cases and deaths currently known to CDPH. Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases and deaths, sources used, how cases and deaths are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19. This dataset contains counts of people tested for COVID-19 and their results. This dataset differs from https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/gkdw-2tgv in that each person is in this dataset only once, even if tested multiple times. In the other dataset, each test is counted, even if multiple tests are performed on the same person, although a person should not appear in that dataset more than once on the same day unless he/she had both a positive and not-positive test. Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider. Only polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests are included, and only one test is counted for each individual. Tests are counted on the day the specimen was collected. A small number of tests collected prior to 3/1/2020 are not included in the table. Positive lab results are confirmed for COVID-19. Not-positive lab results include negative results, invalid results, and tests not performed due to improper collection. Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) does not receive all not-positive results. Demographic data are more complete for those who test positive; care should be taken when calculating percentage positivity among demographic groups. All data are provisional and subject to change.

,"COVID-19 Cases, Tests, and Deaths by ZIP Code","This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on! This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html. For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19. Only Chicago residents are included based on the home ZIP Code as provided by the medical provider. If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as ""Unknown"". Confirmed cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the ""Cases - Weekly"" column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among confirmed cases based on the week of death. For tests, each individual is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts do not include multiple tests for the same person or some negative tests not reported to CDPH. The ""Percent Tested Positive"" columns are calculated by dividing the corresponding Cases and Tests columns. Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, as well as strict criteria for performing COVID-19 tests, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. Of particular note, these rates do not represent population-level disease surveillance. Population counts are from the 2010 Decennial Census. All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. To compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.
