We work to update the &quot;Parcel - ID&quot; fields (and associated map geometry) as needed to reflect new parcels created by lot splits, lot combinations and other processes that redefine parcels, and audit changes at least annually.<br><br><strong>Parcel - Name:&nbsp;</strong>Every parcel currently owned by the HRA is given a plain-language unique name, unique to that &quot;Parcel - ID&quot;. Often the parcel name is comprised simply of the parcel&#39;s address. But often a parcel is named something else to tie it to a landmark or particular street corner. Each parcel is part of a site. Sites are an assemblage of one or more parcels that generally share geographic proximity and are marketed together as a unit. Many sites are just one parcel, but when they are more than one parcel, the parcel name reflects this. Parcels within a site will\n    share the same basic name, but be differentiated by a &quot;#1&quot;, &quot;#2&quot;, &quot;#3&quot;, etc. appended to the end of the name. Sites are generally numbered from northwest to southeast. Additional parcels may be added to a site, but the naming of existing parcels should not ever change - a parcel name should remain unique over time. Further, in some cases parcels are combined or split through a subdivision-level change. In these cases, parcels will generally be given a new site name, and/or new parcel numbers (higher than the ones previously assigned), as it is deemed appropriate. In certain cases, such as when land is taken or given back for public right-of way but the parcel boundary remains fundamentally unchanged, the word &quot;Updated&quot; may be inserted in the name of the parcel before the # at the end. It is important that the last item in a parcel name be the number because of how some internal map dashboard queries are structured. And again, in no case should\n    a parcel name be repeated and used on a parcel with a different Parcel - ID.<br><br><strong>Parcel - Address:&nbsp;</strong>The street address of a parcel, as found in the Ramsey County Parcel Service. Properties without a structure will generally have an address of &quot;0&quot;&#39;; the parcel name field is designed to help in these cases locate the parcel in space without need for mapping.<br><br><strong>Parcel - Land Use Code Description:&nbsp;</strong>This comes directly from the Ramsey County Parcel Service classification for this parcel. This is updated several times per year in order to stay reasonably current with any data updates.<br><br><strong>Parcel - Zoning:</strong> The code for the the zoning designation assigned to this parcel derived directly from the Principal Zoning GIS layer. This is updated several times per year in order to stay reasonably current with any data updates.
