The Chicago Park District partners with the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Public Health Laboratory to analyze water samples using a new DNA testing method called Rapid Testing Method (qPCR analysis) which tests for Enterococci in order to monitor swimming safety. \n \nThe rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a 4-5 hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 1000* CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow swim advisory flag is implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/health/recreation).\n \nHistorically, the Chicago Park District used the culture based analysis method and statistical prediction models to monitor beach water quality. \nThe culture based method tests for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria which is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. The Chicago Park District would use results of the culture based method to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 235* CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented. This standard is still used at most beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria.\n \nThe statistical prediction model forecasted real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). The Chicago Park District would use results of the predictive model to notify the public when bacteria levels would exceed 235 CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented.\n \n* The unit of measurement for Escherichia coli is Colony Forming Units (CFU) per 100 milliliters of water. (Culture Based Method / Statistical Prediction Model)\n*The unit of measuring DNA is Enterococci Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE) per 100 milliliters of water.

Scores are calculated and placed on a scale ranging from 0 (extremely low risk) to 500 (extremely high risk). \r\n\r\nBased on this time frame\u2019s version of the Strategic Subject Algorithm, individuals with criminal records are ranked using eight attributes, not including race or sex. These attributes are: number of times being the victim of a shooting incident, age during the latest arrest, number of times being the victim of aggravated battery or assault, number of prior arrests for violent offenses, gang affiliation, number of prior narcotic arrests, trend in recent criminal activity and number of prior unlawful use of weapon arrests. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this data set includes fields that are not used to calculate SSL, for example, neither race nor sex are used in the Strategic Subject Algorithm.

This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe\u2019s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite\u2019s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1).

Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.

The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: \u2022\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. \u2022\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. \u2022\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council.

Newer records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x. The most recent estimates for each region are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves.

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet.

This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html).

Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions.\r\n \r\nThese GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council.

Inclusion of a driver in a monthly report indicates that the driver was eligible for trips in Chicago in that month for at least one day, regardless of whether he or she actually provided any rides.

Drivers reported by more than one company in the same month are combined and the MULTIPLE_TNPS column is marked as TRUE. However, the matching process is imperfect so not all such drivers are necessarily identified. Similarly, matching between the licensing and routine reporting databases is imperfect, creating potential for occasional errors.\n\nThe reporting is done on a monthly basis, as indicated in the MONTH_REPORTED column. However, starting in 2018, the reports are batched and files for all three months in a quarter are delivered to the City of Chicago at the end of each quarter.

These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: \u2022\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. \u2022\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. \u2022\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, are required.

Measurements are made from the property line and exclude streets, alleys, and public ways. This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs. There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: \u2022\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. \u2022\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. \u2022\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use this KML file, special GIS software such as Google Earth is required.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "keyword": ["traffic", "sustainability"], "title": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments", "issued": "2014-09-26", "modified": "2020-04-14", "theme": ["Transportation"], "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf", "distribution": [{"downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.rdf"}, {"downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/json", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.json"}, {"downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/xml", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.svc"}], "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "cocadmin"}, "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "OUTDATED.

The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery.

The most recent 14 days are not shown due to revised data being submitted to the City of Chicago during this period.

Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., \u201cAll Times\u201d / \u201cAnytime\u201d; \u201cMonday through Friday\u201d; \u201c6am \u2013 6pm All Days.\u201d  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.
