CHILDREN_POVERTY_USCB_IN was derived and modified from a preexisting ESRI shapefile named
SCHOOL_DISTRICTS_USCB_IN. Data regarding children in poverty were obtained from
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/saipe/district.html . Discussion of these data, which are estimates produced
under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program,
are provided at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/saipe/school/sd04over.html .

Data regarding children (ages 5 to 17) from families in poverty in Indiana in 2004, tabulated by school district,
were obtained from a Web page of the U.S. Census Bureau. These data, which are estimates produced under the Census
Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, were then incorporated into a preexisting
shapefile showing school districts in Indiana, as of 2000. Data that were obtained for each school district included
total population of each district, population of relevant children (ages 5 to 17), and number of children from
families in poverty. A new field, giving the percentage of children in each district that are from families in
poverty, was calculated by dividing the number of children in poverty by the population of relevant children.

The SAIPE data were produced for school districts as they existed in 2005-2006. It was not possible to find a boundary
file for school districts in those years, so a boundary file for 2000 was used. In a few areas, it was not possible to
match the SAIPE data with the 2000 school-district boundaries. This is presumably the result of changes (such as mergers
or divisions) of school districts between 2000 and 2006.

Regarding the preexisting shapefile showing school districts, the following is excerpted from an online document produced
by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html):

"School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational
services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from
state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in the 1970 census. For Census 2000,
the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified.

"Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by
the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name."

No formal metadata in the format of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
was provided by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to the source data for this shapefile.

The following is from the U.S. Census Bureau Web document (http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/saipe/school/sd04over.html):

"Background. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) directs the Department of Education to distribute Title I basic
and concentration grants directly to school districts on the basis of the most recent estimates of children in poverty
available from the Census Bureau. These estimates are produced under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty
Estimates (SAIPE) program. The estimates are based on Census 2000 and the SAIPE program's model-based estimates of poverty
for all counties.

"The 2004 estimates correspond with 2005-2006 school district boundaries, while the 2001 - 2003 estimates are for districts
according to their 2003-2004 boundaries.

"SAIPE school district estimates. Three estimates are provided for each school district: total population, children ages 5-17,
related children ages 5-17 in families in poverty.

"The number of related school-age children in families in poverty in each school district is provided as a component of the
determination of Title I grants. The estimate of the total population of each district is provided for use in the small
district (less than 20,000 population) provision. The figure for school-age children is provided so that the proportion
of children in poverty can be determined. This proportion is required for determining eligibility for grants. A true poverty
"rate" for children cannot be determined from these figures, because the numerator and denominator refer to slightly
different universes.

"The school district estimates are based upon tabulations of poverty from Census 2000, using school district boundaries
corresponding to school year 2005 - 2006. These tabulated data are then combined with the SAIPE program county estimates of
poverty, utilizing methods consistent with the SAIPE program school district estimates since income year 1995. By
construction, the SAIPE program school district estimates are arithmetically consistent with the SAIPE program county and
state estimates, and with the national estimate from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the Current
Population Survey (CPS) - the official source of national poverty estimates.

"Spatial Boundaries of School Districts. We provide poverty estimates for all school districts that are in the Census Bureau’s
TIGER database, updated by each School District Review Program; the most recent was completed in 2006. We also tabulate and
produce estimates for all occupied areas not assigned to any school district. We refer to these areas as “balances” of the
counties in which they occur, whether they comprise a single compact area or not. Although we do not publish estimates for
"balance of county" areas on our website, they are provided to the U.S. Department of Education for implementing provisions
of NCLB, and are available upon request.

"Grade Ranges of School Districts. For each school district, our estimates pertain to all resident school-age children ages
5-17, inclusive, whether enrolled in public or private school, or not enrolled. Where two districts divide the children of
an area between them by grade, the estimates do so as well. In most areas, districts called "elementary" or "unified" are,
no matter their names, responsible for providing education for all elementary and secondary grades – either by operating
schools themselves or by purchasing instruction from neighboring school districts – for all residents of their territory.
In these areas, data for all people ages 5-17, inclusive, are tabulated in the district in which they reside.

"Some states have areas with separate "elementary" and "secondary" school districts, each exclusively responsible for
providing education in some grades in their shared territory.1 In these areas, data for school-age children are allocated
between districts on the basis of the grade range of the district and the grade assigned to the child. There are also some
states that have school districts with different grade ranges in different parts of their territory.2 In most cases these
are districts that are "unified" in part of their domain, and "secondary" in the rest. The final tabulations and estimates
reflect the combination of data honoring these distinctions.

"Grade ranges for each district are collected during the boundary update, and supplemented with phone calls to districts.
We attempt to assign a single grade range to each district which, in the case of spatially overlapping districts, leaves no
grade unclaimed and no grade claimed by more than one district. Occasionally the pattern of grade ranges of overlapping
districts does not permit each grade to be assigned to exactly one and only one district. In these few instances, three
simple rules are applied: If a "unified" district is present, data for children whose assigned grade is claimed by two
districts or not claimed by either are allocated to the "unified" district. If an "elementary" and "secondary" district are
present, data for children whose assigned grade is claimed by both are allocated to the "secondary" district. If an
"elementary" and "secondary" district are present, data for children whose assigned grade is claimed by neither are
allocated to the "elementary" district.

"Grades for Children. To tabulate the data for each district, each child is assigned a grade. In the Census 2000 sample,
where responses to the "long-form" questions are available, 97 percent of children are assigned a grade on the basis of
their edited reports of the grade in which they were enrolled. Because this question used response categories that represent
multiple grades (PK, KG, 1st – 4th, 5th – 8th, 9th-12th, higher), the child’s age in October was used to assign single
grades from among those implied by the answer. For those not enrolled, the modal grade for their age in October (age on
October 1, 1999 less 5) was assigned, provided that the grade assigned was not reported as having been completed. For Census
2000 short-form data, where school enrollment and educational attainment are not available, children were assigned the modal
grade for their age on October 1, 1999.

"With the Census 2000 record for each child assigned to a single 2005-2006 school district, to which that child is said to be
"relevant," we tabulate for each district: “Relevant” children ages 5-17, inclusive. "Relevant" children who are related to
the householder and reside in families whose 1999 income falls below the poverty threshold appropriate to that family. Total
population of all ages residing in the spatial boundaries of the district. (Note that because of overlapping districts, the
sum of the total populations of the districts will exceed the total population of the nation.) Related children are people
ages 5-17 related by birth, marriage, or adoption to the householder of the housing unit in which they reside; foster
children, other unrelated individuals, and residents of group quarters are not "related children".

"Constructing the SAIPE program estimates. The SAIPE program procedure for estimating poverty among relevant children ages
5-17 in families works with geographical units we call school-district-county-pieces. These pieces are defined as the
intersections of school districts and counties (i.e., all of a district if it does not cross county boundaries and each
county part separately for districts that do). If a school district has territory in two counties, for example, we make
estimates for the two parts separately and then combine them. School districts with territory in a single county are composed
of a single piece.

"The first step in making the school district poverty estimates is to estimate poverty rates for income year 1999 from Census
2000. The poverty rates for relevant school-aged children in families are estimated using a method called "estimated best
linear unbiased predictor" (EBLUP) with a simple model. Using EBLUP, the estimate for each school district piece in a county
is the weighted average of the direct sample estimate (produced as described above) for all of the school district pieces in
that county. The weight for a school district piece depends on the relative variance of its sampling error and the variance
between the school district pieces’ true poverty rates within the county. The effect of this procedure is to "shrink" the
estimates toward a county-wide poverty rate, so we often refer to this kind of estimator as a "shrinkage" estimator.

"School district pieces can be very small, in which case the sampling-error variances of the estimates from Census 2000
sample data can be very high. In extreme cases, the Census 2000 estimates of the number of people in poverty in a school
district might be zero or may exceed the population. Since these estimates are used throughout the decade, the effects of
large sampling errors can have lasting effects. The shrinkage procedure produces estimates of poverty rates that are greater
than zero and less than 100 percent in nearly every case. Further, the overall magnitude of the error is reduced under the
fairly general model for which these estimates are derived. Beginning with the 2003 estimates, we implemented an improved
method for our shrinkage estimator. The expected value of poverty rates for school district pieces within counties are
unchanged, but the standard errors are reduced.

"To get estimates of the number of relevant children ages 5-17 in families in poverty , we multiply the shrinkage estimate of
poverty rates by the Census 2000 counts of the numbers of relevant related children ages 5-17. The numbers of children in
poverty are then adjusted, using “controlled rounding,” to get a result with the following properties:
The number of children in poverty in the school district pieces are integers. This is possible, in part, because the
county-level estimates have already been adjusted so they have the same properties relative to the states, which, in turn,
have the same properties relative to the national CPS ASEC estimated number of school-aged children in poverty. The
controlled rounding has the approximate effect of calculating the shares of a county’s children in poverty who reside in the
school district pieces from the shrinkage estimates and apportioning the SAIPE program county estimated children in poverty
to the school district pieces according to those shares. The final step is to reassemble the school district pieces into the
school districts, simply by adding their controlled-rounded numbers of children in poverty together."

Pertaining to school districts, the following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau Web document produced by the U.S.
Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html):

"School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational

"Grades for Children. To tabulate the data for each district, each child is assigned a grade. In the Census 2000 sample,
where responses to the "long-form" questions are available, 97 percent of children are assigned a grade on the basis of
their edited reports of the grade in which they were enrolled. Because this question used response categories that represent
multiple grades (PK, KG, 1st – 4th, 5th – 8th, 9th-12th, higher), the child’s age in October was used to assign single
grades from among those implied by the answer. For those not enrolled, the modal grade for their age in October (age on
October 1, 1999 less 5) was assigned, provided that the grade assigned was not reported as having been completed. For Census
2000 short-form data, where school enrollment and educational attainment are not available, children were assigned the modal
grade for their age on October 1, 1999.

"With the Census 2000 record for each child assigned to a single 2005-2006 school district, to which that child is said to be
"relevant," we tabulate for each district: “Relevant” children ages 5-17, inclusive. "Relevant" children who are related to
the householder and reside in families whose 1999 income falls below the poverty threshold appropriate to that family. Total
population of all ages residing in the spatial boundaries of the district. (Note that because of overlapping districts, the
sum of the total populations of the districts will exceed the total population of the nation.) Related children are people
ages 5-17 related by birth, marriage, or adoption to the householder of the housing unit in which they reside; foster
children, other unrelated individuals, and residents of group quarters are not "related children".

"Constructing the SAIPE program estimates. The SAIPE program procedure for estimating poverty among relevant children ages
5-17 in families works with geographical units we call school-district-county-pieces. These pieces are defined as the
intersections of school districts and counties (i.e., all of a district if it does not cross county boundaries and each
county part separately for districts that do). If a school district has territory in two counties, for example, we make
estimates for the two parts separately and then combine them. School districts with territory in a single county are composed
of a single piece.

"The first step in making the school district poverty estimates is to estimate poverty rates for income year 1999 from Census
2000. The poverty rates for relevant school-aged children in families are estimated using a method called "estimated best
linear unbiased predictor" (EBLUP) with a simple model. Using EBLUP, the estimate for each school district piece in a county
is the weighted average of the direct sample estimate (produced as described above) for all of the school district pieces in
that county. The weight for a school district piece depends on the relative variance of its sampling error and the variance
between the school district pieces’ true poverty rates within the county. The effect of this procedure is to "shrink" the
estimates toward a county-wide poverty rate, so we often refer to this kind of estimator as a "shrinkage" estimator.

"School district pieces can be very small, in which case the sampling-error variances of the estimates from Census 2000
sample data can be very high. In extreme cases, the Census 2000 estimates of the number of people in poverty in a school
district might be zero or may exceed the population. Since these estimates are used throughout the decade, the effects of
large sampling errors can have lasting effects. The shrinkage procedure produces estimates of poverty rates that are greater
than zero and less than 100 percent in nearly every case. Further, the overall magnitude of the error is reduced under the
fairly general model for which these estimates are derived. Beginning with the 2003 estimates, we implemented an improved
method for our shrinkage estimator. The expected value of poverty rates for school district pieces within counties are
unchanged, but the standard errors are reduced.

"To get estimates of the number of relevant children ages 5-17 in families in poverty , we multiply the shrinkage estimate of
poverty rates by the Census 2000 counts of the numbers of relevant related children ages 5-17. The numbers of children in
poverty are then adjusted, using “controlled rounding,” to get a result with the following properties:
The number of children in poverty in the school district pieces are integers. This is possible, in part, because the
county-level estimates have already been adjusted so they have the same properties relative to the states, which, in turn,
have the same properties relative to the national CPS ASEC estimated number of school-aged children in poverty. The
controlled rounding has the approximate effect of calculating the shares of a county’s children in poverty who reside in the
school district pieces from the shrinkage estimates and apportioning the SAIPE program county estimated children in poverty
to the school district pieces according to those shares. The final step is to reassemble the school district pieces into the
school districts, simply by adding their controlled-rounded numbers of children in poverty together."

Pertaining to school districts, the following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau Web document produced by the U.S.
Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html):

"School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational
services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from
tate officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in the 1970 census. For Census 2000,
the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified.

"Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by
the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name."

Data regarding estimates of children from families in poverty in Indiana in 2004, by school district, were
obtained from a Web site of the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) Program, U.S. Census Bureau.
Using a preexisting shapefile showing school districts in Indiana in 2000, data were exported and a spreadsheet
was created with attributes including each school-district identification number and name. The data regarding
estimates of poverty were then added to that spreadsheet. In a few records, there were no matches between the data
obtained from the shapefile (2000) and the data regarding poverty estimates (2004), presumably because of changes
in school-district boundaries (such as mergers or divisions) between 2000 and 2004. The data from the combined
spreadsheet were then saved as a comma-delimited CSV file. The CSV file was added to an ArcMap project, as was the
shapefile showing school-district boundaries in 2000. The data in the CSV file were then joined to the shapefile,
using the "Join" function in ArcMap.
