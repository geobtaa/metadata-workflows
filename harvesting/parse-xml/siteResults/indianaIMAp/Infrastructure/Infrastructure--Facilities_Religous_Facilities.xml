This data set was compiled by personnel of Bernardin, Lochmueller &amp; Associates (BLA) from the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), USGS topographic map review,
and locating addresses found on various religious listing web sites. To find out more about the USGS,
GNIS visit http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html. Web sites used to obtain address listings for additional
listings include - Dharma Web &lt;http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Indiana&gt;, Jewish Finder
&lt;http://www.ujc.org/ir_LL_category.html?state=in&gt;, and The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints

      <abstract>
A data set showing the locations of religious centers and places of worship in Indiana.
The base file for this effort was the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) data for churches current to 20070125.
In 2001, BLA ground truthed churches in the current GNIS data for a large area in southern Indiana. Many locations were added.
These locations were checked against the new 2007 GNIS data for duplicates, and were added to the dataset. In order to find additional
locations and locations for facilities for non-Christian religions, the internet was searched for lists of locations for various
religions.  Addresses found were located using Google Maps &lt;http://maps.google.com/&gt; and plotted in GIS using aerials.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
To provide the locations of religious centers and places of worship in Indiana as a GIS layer.  While the base file is 2007 GNIS data,
it has been expanded with locations obtained by ground truthing and locations of facilities for non-Christian religions.

Data attributes are accurate to the information source.

The following was excerpted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic
Names Information System (GNIS) metadata -

"During Phase I data compilation, a random sample of 10% of the entries in the system were
visually verified against the compilation source data (large-scale USGS topographic maps)
to ensure an accuracy rate of at least 95%. Subsequent data compilation and input processes
ensure accuracy with programmed validation checks for format and content, visual examination,
and spot checks of data."

BLA 2001 ground truthing data is believed to be very accurate.  Points were marked on aerial printouts in the
field and placed on digital aerials in the GIS.

BLA 2007 internet locations relies on Google Maps to locate listed addresses.  No confidence level is provided by
Google Maps, but as each point was digitzed, the location was checked with GIS files for roads and county and others.
Becasue of this cross checking and individual point placement by an analyst, the locatitons are beleived to be accurate,
although no testing has been performed.

This data set contains the records from the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and is further
supplemented by locating address found on web site listings for churches and other
religious centers. Additional records in southwestern Indiana were located by
field review and topographic map review in areas associated with Interstate 69 studies.

The following was excerpted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic
Names Information System (GNIS) metadata -

"Subsequent to the original data compilation process, which was taken primarily from Federal maps,
the GNIS has become dependent on input from Federal, State, county, and local government agencies
and other approved sources. The completeness, currency, and accuracy of the data varies by area
depending on the quality and timeliness of that input. Accordingly, the Geographic Names Project
actively seeks to expand partnerships with Government agencies at all levels and other interested
organizations. The latest tools and methodologies are being applied, including web map and feature
services, and joint or linked web applications, to ensure that local data are properly represented
in the GNIS and through the GNIS to all Federal agencies and to the public. Feature additions or
corrections are accepted for consideration from any source, and when validated by appropriate agencies,
will be entered into the database. Local and State agencies are encouraged to submit data and to
participate in the GNIS partnership program. Non-government organizations with valuable data are
considered on a case basis. Data entered into the GNIS immediately is available to all web services
and applications dependent on it. For additional information or to request user accounts for entry
and edit of production data and web seminar training, contact gnis_manager@usgs.gov."

BLA field review locations were limited to areas associated with a proposed Interstate, which will be
located in Southern Indiana.  More additions are present in southern Indiana counties.

Horizontal accuracy is dependant on the USGS data source
and supplemental data was positioned using Google Maps &lt;http://maps.google.com/&gt;.  Large scale use and precision
applications are not recommended.

The following was excerpted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic
Names Information System (GNIS) metadata -

"Accuracy of these digital data are based upon the use of printed or electronic source graphics which
are compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. Comparison to the graphic source is used as
control to assess digital positional accuracy."

The internet was used perform Google searches to locate directories of address of non-Christian religions, Mormon (CJCLDS) facilities,
Jehovah's Witness facilities, Amish churches, Mennonite Churches, and Quaker Churches. Web sites used included - Dharma Web
&lt;http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Indiana&gt;, Jewish Finder &lt;http://www.ujc.org/ir_LL_category.html?state=in&gt;, and
The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints &lt;http://www.mormon.org/worshipwithus/1,20864,,00.html&gt;.  The web site
&lt;http://www.churchangel.com/&gt;, was used to locate additional Christian church addresses in
select counties.  The counties were - Bartholomew, Benton, Brown, Clark, Clay, Crawford,
Daviess, Dearborn, Decatur, Dubois, Floyd, Franklin, Gibson, Greene, Harrison, Jackson,
Jefferson, Jennings, Knox, Lawrence, Martin, Monroe, Morgan, Ohio, Orange, Owen, Perry, Pike, Posey,
Ripley, Scott, Sullivan, Switzerland, Vanderburgh, Vigo, Warrick, and Washington.
Addresses were located using Google Map &lt;http://maps.google.com/&gt;, then located in the GIS using an aerial
and Tiger Line files for the roads.  The locations were made into a temporary shapefile.

GNIS feature data for Indiana was downloaded from the USGS, GNIS
web site, &lt;http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html&gt;.
Data tables were converted to a shapefile using the primary
latitude and primary longitude as reference. Churches in
Indiana were extracted by attribute/location query from all features.
The file was transformed from geographic to UTM 16, NAD83.

Each temporary file was compared using location queries and "intersect" to locate any points between files within 3
meters of each other.  A few duplicates were found and resolved. A location query was used to find any points falling
outside the Indiana boundary.  One was located and deleted.
The three temporary shapefiles, CHURCHES_BLAADDED_2007.SHP, GNIS_20070125.SHP, and CHURCHES_BLA_I69.SHP were merged
together.
