This shapefile was derived from a predecessor shapefile, named "SCHOOL.SHP," which was
from a shapefile (named "EFSCHOOL.SHP") provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). EFA was included on a CD-ROM (titled "HAZUS99,
Central US") that is the product of a program referred to as "HAZUS, The FEMA Tool for Estimating
Earthquake Losses." The original shapefile has been modified by personnel of the IGS. These metadata
were created by personnel of IGS, using information included in the HAZUS user's manuals.

SCHOOLS_HAZUS_IN is a point shapefile that shows locations of school buildings in Indiana. In
addition to public and private schools and universities, the shapefile contains locations of preschools,
trade schools, language schools, hair-styling schools, obedience schools, and others. SCHOOLS_HAZUS_IN was
derived from a shapefile named "SCHOOLS.SHP." A predecessor shapefile of SCHOOLS, named "EFSCHOOLS.SHP,"
was obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). The shapefile was included on a CD-ROM (titled
"arcHAZUS97, Eastern US") that is the product of a program referred to as "HAZUS, The FEMA Tool for
Estimating Earthquake Losses." The original shapefile (referred to as "EFSCHOOLS.SHP") has been modified
by personnel of the IGS. This metadata was created by personnel of IGS, using information included in
the HAZUS user's manuals. Data for the predecessor shapefile was obtained from a FEMA Database (1992)
(HAZUS99, Technical and User Manuals, Appendices.pdf, Appendix D, Summary of Inventory Databases.)
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The predecessor shapefile ("EFSCHOOLS.SHP") was produced by FEMA and NIBS to serve as supplemental data
for use by HAZUS, a software tool for estimating earthquake losses. That predecessor shapefile was then
modified by personnel of IGS to provide a GIS layer that could be included within the GIS repository
of IGS.

Unknown. No records exist at the Indiana Geological Survey regarding the attribute
accuracy of this shapefile. However, reviewers for the Indiana Geological Survey discovered that addresses in
the attribute table are not complete for every school or institution listed. A cursory comparison was made
between this shapefile and an shapefile of school locations obtained from the Environmental Systems Research
Institute (ESRI). There were many points that appeared on the HAZUS shapefile that did not appear on the ESRI
shapefile, and vice versa. For more information, contact HAZUS Technical Support: ph: 800-955-9442,

Unknown. No records exist at the Indiana Geological Survey
regarding the horizontal positional accuracy of this shapefile.  A cursory comparison was made between this
shapefile and an shapefile of school locations obtained from the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI).
However, where the same facilities appeared on both HAZUS and ESRI, there were sometimes spatial displacements
of as much as 3 miles. These displacements were not systematic (i.e., they occurred in various directions
and with various displacements), indicating that they are the result of the method by which the data points
were originally identified and located (such as the "geocoding" method), rather than some consequence of the
method of projection. For more information, contact HAZUS Technical Support: ph: 800-955-9442, fax: 404-261-0117

A shapefile named "EFSCHOOLS.SHP" was obtained from the CD-ROM titled "arcHAZUS97, Eastern US" by
personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). The shapefile was opened in ESRI ArcView. Within
ESRI ArcView, the projection was set to UTM NAD83, Zone 16. The original shapefile was then converted
to another shapefile (named "SCHOOLS.SHP") by using the "Convert to Shapefile" utility of ESRI ArcView.
The Table Edit function of ESRI ArcView was then used to drop the following fields: District, Contact,
Mapping, Bldg_type, Designlvl, Bias, Foundation, Year_b, Cost, Bu_pwr, Function, Num_studnt, Area,
Shlt_cap, Kitchen, Elevat, Lat, Long, Geores, County, and Comment.
