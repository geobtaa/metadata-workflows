Phone numbers, addresses, and information regarding type of facility were obtained from Web pages
of the Indiana State Department of Health (http://www.indiana.gov/isdh/regsvcs/acc/hospital/wdirhos.htm;
http://www.in.gov/isdh/regsvcs/acc/rhcdir/wdirrhc.htm).
Personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey used ESRI ArcMap 9.2 to build an "Address Locator" and used
the "Geocoding" tool to perform address matching, using street information licensed from Tele Atlas, Dynamap/2000, v. 17.0.

HOSPITALS_CLINICS_ISDH_IN is a point shapefile showing the locations of 160 hospitals included in a "Hospital Directory" that
appears on a Web page of the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) (http://www.indiana.gov/isdh/regsvcs/acc/hospital/wdirhos.htm),
as well as the locations of 55 rural health clinics included in a "Rural Health Care Clinic Directory" that appears on
the ISDH Web site (http://www.in.gov/isdh/regsvcs/acc/rhcdir/wdirrhc.htm).
Using street addresses from the directory, a shapefile was created using the "Geocoding" tool in ESRI ArcMap 9.2 and
street information licensed from Tele Atlas, Dynamap 2000 v. 17.0. On May 11, 2009, at the request of a user, the location of

Street addresses and telephone numbers for hospitals and rural health clinics were obtained from the Web site of the
Indiana State Department of Health and are assumed to be accurate. Geocoding produced match scores of more than
80 percent for 90 percent of hospitals on the "Hospital Directory" obtained from a Web site of the Indiana State
Department of Health and for 74 percent of rural health clinics. Locations of other hospitals and rural health clinics
with scores less than 80 percent were plotted by personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey using the "Editor" tool
in ESRI ArcMap version 9.2, together with information obtained from Google searches, MapQuest (http://www.mapquest.com/maps/),
and inspection of aerial photographs of the 2005 Indiana Orthophotography Project.

All hospitals listed by the Indiana State Department of Health have been included. Fifty-five (55) of

near Williamsport and Veedersburg, respectively) could not be located using either Tele Atlas, Dynamap 2000, or Mapquest,
and these were deleted from the list of rural health clinics.

IGS personnel used street information licensed from Tele Atlas in ESRI ArcMap 9.2 to build an "Address Locator." Using
the "Geocoding" tool to perform address matching, HOSPITAL_LOCATIONS.XLS and CLINIC_LOCATIONS.XLS were address-
matched. A total of 144 hospitals were matched to known addresses. Sixteen (16) hospital locations needed to be manually
plotted using the "Editor" tool in ESRI ArcMap, together with locations obtained using Google searches, MapQuest, and
inspection of aerial photographs of the 2005 Indiana Orthophotography Project. The output was saved as HOSPITALS_ISDH_IN.SHP.
The following fields were then deleted from the attribute table: "Side," "ARC_Street," "ARC_Zone," "Zip," and "State."
A total of 48 clinics were matched to known addresses. Seven (7) clinic locations needed to be manually plotted using the "Editor"
tool in ESRI ArcMap, together with locations obtained using Google searches, MapQuest, and inspection of aerial photographs of
the 2005 Indiana Orthophotography Project. Two (2) clincs were deleted because they could not be located using Google searches
and Mapquest. The output was saved as CLINICS_ISDH_IN.SHP. The following fields were then deleted from the attribute table:
"Side," "ARC_Street," "ARC_Zone," "Zip," and "State."
Using ESRI ArcToolbox, HOSPITALS_ISDH_IN.SHP and CLINICS_ISDH_IN.SHP were merged to create HOSPITALS_CLINICS_ISDH_IN.SHP
