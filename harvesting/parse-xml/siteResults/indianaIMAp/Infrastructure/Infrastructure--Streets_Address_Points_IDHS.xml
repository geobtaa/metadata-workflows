COUNTY_ADDRESS_POINTS_IDHS_IN is an ESRI Geodatabase point feature class that contains address points maintained by county agencies in Indiana, provided by
personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) as of June 29, 2009, and subsequently updated on September 30, 2009, December 2, 2009,
December 28, 2009, February 2, 2010, March 5, 2010, April 6, 2010, October 11, 2010, November 19, 2010, March 22, 2011, September 8, 2011, January 30, 2012,

provided by IDHS in ESRI feature class and was named "County_Point_Address." This data set was compiled by IDHS as part of the IndianaMap Data Sharing Initiative
between IGIC, Indiana Office of Technology (IOT), Indiana Geographic Information Office (GIO), Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS), Indiana Geological
Survey (IGS) and participating Indiana counties to provide the most accurate framework data (including address points, street centerlines, land parcels, and
governmental boundaries) for the citizens of Indiana. More information is available at the following Web URL:  http://www.igic.org/news/index.php?itemid=265
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This data set was developed to provide accurate framework data (including address points, street centerlines, land parcels, and governmental boundaries) for Indiana,
as part of the IndianaMap Data Sharing Initiative (DSI).

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named "County_Point_Address.shp" from IGIC personnel
(Phill Worrall) on February 2, 2010. "County_Point_Address.shp" was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.3.1 and the
data were examined for completeness. The following fields were deleted from the attribute table; "Permanant_Identifier,"
"Source_FeatureID," "Source_DataDesc," "Data_Security," "Distribution_Policy," "Local_Address_ID," "CollectionMethod,"
"Current_Status," and "Empty."
Also, data provided by GIS personnel of Wayne County, Indiana that were geographically located in Ohio
were also deleted (19,225 records). The shapefile was then renamed to COUNTY_ADDRESS_POINTS_IDHS_IN.SHP to conform
to IGS naming conventions.

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named "County_Point_Address.shp" from IGIC personnel (Phill Worrall) on May 6, 2013
(harvested on April 27, 2013). "County_Point_Address.shp" was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 10 and the data were examined for completeness.
The following fields were deleted from the attribute table; "Permanent_Identifier," "Source_FeatureID," "Source_DataDesc," and
"Current_Status." The shapefile was then exported to an ESRI file geodatabase named COUNTY_ADDRESS_POINTS_IDHS_IN.GDB to conform to IGS naming
conventions.
