This data set was provided to personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) by Indiana Department of Homeland
Security (IDHS) personnel. The data set provided was in an ESRI shapefile format, and was named "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp"
on June 29, 2009. "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp" was originally prepared in March 2009 for IDHS by TechniGraphics, Inc. (TGS),
Wooster, Ohio, 44691. TGS included the following statement to IDHS upon delivery of "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp":

"TGS has made a concerted effort to include all general medical/surgical hospitals in Indiana. Other types
of hospitals are included if they were represented in datasets sent by the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty
hospitals in Indiana are represented in this dataset. This dataset is free of license restrictions. Geographic locations
were determined relative to NAVTEQ 2008Q1 streets."

HOSPITALS_HSIP_IDHS_IN is a point shapefile that contains hospital locations, as developed for the Homeland Security
Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009.
This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp."

The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic
Information Council (IGIC):

"Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP)

After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nation’s critical infrastructure and developed an
acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working
Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different
version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.

"HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold
is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity
datasets and Federal &amp; State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes.
These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as
“disclosure” in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the
event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government
organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.

"HSIP Freedom: NGA’s goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is
the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach – HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data
to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be
able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.

"The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State &amp; Federal information on: Fire
Stations, EMS Stations &amp; Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons &amp; Jails, Hospitals &amp; Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS)
was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to
date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities.
Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery.
TGS incorporates the improved State data into the "License Free” HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate
the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey
for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp":

"Hospitals in Indiana

"The term "hospital" means an institution which:

"(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients

" 	(A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or
" 	(B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;

"(5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered
professional nurse on duty at all times; ...

"(7) in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals,

" 	(A) is licensed pursuant to such law or
" 	(B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing;

"(Excerpt from Title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)], &lt;http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001395---x000-.html&gt;)

"Included in this dataset are General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals (e.g., Children's Hospitals,
Cancer Hospitals, Maternity Hospitals, Rehabilitation Hospitals, etc.).

"TGS has made a concerted effort to include all general medical/surgical hospitals in Indiana. Other types of hospitals are included if they were represented
in datasets sent by the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty hospitals in Indiana are represented in this dataset.

"Hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA) are included, even if the state they are located in does not license VA Hospitals.

"Nursing homes and Urgent Care facilities are excluded because they are included in a separate dataset. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded
from the dataset.

"Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure
(DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

"Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

"All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use
with database systems that may not support diacritics.

"The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this field, the oldest record dates from 10/26/2006 and the newest record dates
from 07/10/2008."

"Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements.

"1) A disaster has overwhelmed local medical facilities and capacity must be found in the surrounding area.

"2) A threat against hospitals has been identified and measures must be taken to protect the hospital.

"3) An assessment as to the adequacy of the total capacity to handle emergency medical care in a given area needs to be made as part of a disaster mitigation plan.

"4) A disaster has occurred, or is in the process of occurring, and facilities in the vicinity with people needing evacuation assistance must be identified."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp":

"For entities that were contacted, the name, address, city, state, and five (5) digit zip codes were verified to be correct as of
the date indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. The existence of the entity was also verified, as well as whether or not it met
the criteria for inclusion in this dataset. Four (4) digit zip code extensions were derived from USPS (United States Postal Service)
data and were not verified.

"ID Check: The [ID] field is not blank and each of its values is unique.

"Coordinate Check: Coordinates are not null or zero and the x and y fields match the shape.

"Basic Address Check: Physical addresses were verified to be non blank and to not be a "PO Box", "General Delivery", "Highway Contract",
or "Rural Route" address.

"Highway Address without Type Check: Physical addresses containing the word "Highway" or "Route" were verified to also contain a type
designator such as "State", "US", or "County", if one actually exists for the highway or route. These type designators are often missing
from addresses, leading to confusion if more than one "Highway" of the given number exists in an area.

"Basic Name Check: Entity name is not blank, is not the same as entity city, and has a minimum of 2 characters. Name does not contain
punctuation characters that can interfere with database operations, such as " (quote) and * (asterisk).

"City Check: Entity's [CITY] field is not blank, and entity is located within 25 miles of its tabular city as found in the NAVTEQ
Named Places reference file.

"State Check: The entity is located within its tabular state.

"County FIPS to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular FIPS Code is actually in the state specified in the [STATE] field.

"County Name to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular county name is actually in the state specified in the [STATE] field.

"Basic Phone Check: All phone numbers (including the area code) are ten (10) numeric digits. Alphabetic characters have been converted to
the corresponding numeric digit.

"NPA_NXX Check: Area codes (sometimes called "Number Planning Areas", or NPA's) and central office codes (sometimes known as exchanges, or NXX's)
were validated against data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA). In some cases, NPA-NXX combinations did not show up
in the NANPA data but were verified to work.

"Area Code Distance Check: The entity's area code (NPA) is valid, and the entity is not more than 25 miles from its area code boundary, as
defined by data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA), unless TGS has previously verified that the phone number
rings to a headquarters location or otherwise does not ring to the entity's location.

"Zip Code Check: The zip code is five (5) or nine (9) numeric digits, is listed in the postal database, is in the same state as indicated
by the entity's [STATE] value, and is not a PO Box only zip code.

"Zip City Check: The entity's zip code and its city were verified to match according to the USPS Address Information System (AIS).

"Zip Code Distance Check: The entity is located within 25 miles of its zip code boundary, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 1999 Zip Code file.

"NAICS Code Check: The NAICS field is not blank, the NAICS Code is one of the accepted codes for this layer, the NAICS Description is an acceptable
Index Entry for the NAICS Code, and certain key words in the entity name do not conflict with the NAICS Code.

"Collocation Check: Entities with different addresses must not share the exact same geospatial location.

"Geographic Spell Check: Words that appear in the entity name were checked against a standard English word list (and Spanish word list for
entities in Puerto Rico). Words not appearing in these standard word lists were then checked against names appearing in the Geographic Names
Information System (GNIS) of geographic features that are located within 25 miles of the entity. Proper names were manually reviewed for correct
spelling."

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp" from IDHS personnel (Roger Koelpin) on June 29, 2009.
"2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp" was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.3.1 and the data were examined for completeness. "2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp"
was reprojected using ESRI ArcToolBox from WGS_1984 to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 16, NAD 83. The shapefile was then renamed
to HOSPITALS_HSIP_IDHS_IN.SHP to conform to IGS naming conventions.

Physical street address for entity. "PO Box", "General Delivery", "Rural Route", and "Highway Contract"
addresses are not considered physical addresses and should not appear in this field. Some areas do not have regular city
style addressing, so entities in those areas may not have a street number. In such cases, the name of the road on which
they are located is listed in this field. Some rural areas may not have named roads. In these rare cases, this field will be blank.

      <attr>
        <attrlabl>CITY</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>
The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS)
delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the
USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable").
The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical
addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code
are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] field will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually
be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its [CITY] field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city
limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this field may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but
it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame",
but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located
in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good
general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable
than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location.
Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an
acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

        <attrlabl>STATE</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>
Two character abbreviation for state associated with the entity's physical address. In almost all cases, this is the same as the state
where the entity has been depicted geospatially. However, there are cases, particularly where an entity is part of a larger facility
that cuts across state lines, where the entity's location may be depicted in a state other than the one indicated in this field. Also,
the state in which an entity appears to be located may change depending on the scale of the state boundary theme being used.

NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Description for entity. The "Index Entries" that appear on the NAICS webpage
(http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html&gt;) are being used to populate this field, as opposed to the "NAICS Title". While there is a
one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and "NAICS Titles", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the
"Index Entries". By using the "Index Entries", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories;
however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these "Index Entries". The "Index Entries" were
intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code
may be named. Thus, there are often two or more "Index Entries" that are synonyms, for example: "Prisons" and "Penitentiaries". In cases
like this, we have standardized on one "Index Entry".

NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of if that is the function
that qualified it to be included in this dataset.
