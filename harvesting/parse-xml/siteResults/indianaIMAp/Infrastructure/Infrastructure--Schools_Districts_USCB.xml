SCHOOL_DISTRICTS_USCB_IN.SHP was derived and modified from a preexisting ESRI shapefile that
was downloaded as a zip file named "sn18_d00_shp.zip" (unified school districts) from the following URL of
the U.S. Census Bureau:

The following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school
districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html):

"School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational
services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from
tate officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in the 1970 census. For Census 2000,
the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified.

Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by
the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name."
</abstract>
      <purpose>SCHOOL_DISTRICTS_USCB_IN.SHP was created to provide a GIS data layer of school districts in Indiana.</purpose>

SN18_D00_E00.ZIP was downloaded from the USCB and unzipped.
ESRI ArcToolBox "Define Projection Wizard" was then used on SN18_D00.SHP to define the projection provided, which was Geographic
(Lat/Long) NAD83. ESRI ArcToolBox "Project Wizard" was then used to reproject to UTM Zone 16, NAD83, and the output shapefile
was named SCHOOL_DISTRICTS_USCB_IN.SHP. ESRI ArcMap was then used to edit the shapefile, and the following fields were
dropped from the attribute table: "Area," "Perimeter," "SN18_D00_," "SN18_D00_I," "State," "LSAD," and "LSAD_TRANS."
