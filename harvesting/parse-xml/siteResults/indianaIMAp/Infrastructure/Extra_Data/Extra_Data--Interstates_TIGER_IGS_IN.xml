This data set is derived from a source data set named "ROADS_TIGER00_IN," which was provided
to the IGS by Bernardin, Lochmueller and Associates. ROADS_TIGER00_IN is based on information
from U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Tiger Line Files.

INTERSTATES_TIGER_IGS_IN is an ESRI ArcGIS shapefile of interstate highways in Indiana. Personnel of the IGS processed
the road information contained in ROADS_TIGER00_IN, as produced by the U.S.
Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, to show only the interstate highways in Indiana.
</abstract>
      <purpose>INTERSTATES_TIGER_IGS_IN was created to show only interstate highways in Indiana.</purpose>
      <supplinf>
INTERSTATES_TIGER_IGS_IN was extracted from the field named "CFCC" in ROADS_TIGER00_IN, using the following
values that designate sections of interstate highways: A11, A13, A15, and A17. Additionally,
some gaps were filled by manual digitization by IGS personnel using ArcGIS.

The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau, TIGER metadata:

"Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS),
FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes
and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been
examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy."

The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau, TIGER metadata:

"The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)
is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong
to the "Geometry and Topology" (GT) class of objects in the "Spatial
Data Transfer Standard" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are
topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain
relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
requirements.  These requirements include:

* Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.

* Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.

* Complete chains do not extend through nodes.

* Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain
element and are consistent throughout the extract process.

* The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.

The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical
consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.
The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update
System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census
TIGER data base.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for
states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding
spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for
logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original
Census TIGER data base files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided
to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining
FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been
fully tested for consistency."
</logic>

From the field named "CFCC" in ROADS_TIGER00_IN, all arcs with the following
values were extracted: A11, A13, A15, and A17. Some missing segments of
interstate highways were manually digitized by IGS personnel. However,
entrance and exit ramps are not shown, nor are all ramps that connect
intersecting interstates.

The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau, TIGER metadata:

"Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the
Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (Census 2000
version) were created."

The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau, TIGER metadata:

"The information present in these files is provided for the purposes
of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates
in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but
the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies
with the source materials used, but generally the information is
no better than the established national map Accuracy standards
for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);
thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications
such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses
that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's
surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy
standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,
1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of
most of the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the
1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding
(GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan
areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The
Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of
what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan
areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that
enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census
TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature
shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made
other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local
participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy
of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal,
State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain
information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared
by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional
accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-
decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision
allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed
in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without
overlap."

The vertical accuracy was not a factor in the digital production
of the data set. No quantitative tests were performed.

The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau, TIGER metadata:

"In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER
data base in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the
Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information
from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically
consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by
the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census
TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the
Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent
area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical
equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length
record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either
line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census
Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files
since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature
and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate
updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous
version." "TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS
environment.  The environment consists of two Alpha Server
8400s clustered together running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used
for production operations.  The Census TIGER system is driven
by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures which invoke C
software routines to extract selected geographic and cartographic
information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational Census TIGER data base."

Bernardin, Lochmueller and Associates transformed AVENZA shapefiles
into UTM Zone 16 NAD 83. A total of 92 files, one for each county,
make up the entire set of Indiana files. Utilizing ESRI ArcView version 3.2
and the ESRI ArcView extension Geoprocessing, merged 92 shapefiles
representing all Indiana counties into a statewide shapefile
named "ROADS_TIGER00_IN."

ESRI ArcGIS 8.3 was used to extract all interstates in Indiana from
ROADS_TIGER00_IN into a new shapefile named "INTERSTATES_TIGER_IGS_IN." The
following values from the field CFCC contained in ROADS_TIGER00_IN were
used to select all interstates: A11, A13, A15, and A17. Manual digitization
was also used to close small gaps in the interstate network, wherever
appropriate.

This metadata was pre-parsed and parsed using CNS (Chew and Spit. v 2.6.1) and
MP (Metadata Parser, v 2.7.1) software written by Peter N. Schweitzer (United

addressed and corrected, except that no values were assigned to
"Abscissa_Resolution" and "Ordinate_Resolution."
