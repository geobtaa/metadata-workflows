This data set was provided to personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) by Indiana
Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping personnel.
The data set provided was in an ESRI shapefile format, and was named "DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN."
This data set was provided to personnel of the IGS on September 13, 2006.
Data is originally from U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition).

NOTE: The U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition) contain realigned street
features for the following Indiana counties: Adams, Blackford, Carroll, Cass, Daviess, Delaware, Dubois, Fulton, Hamilton, Hancock,
Huntington, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Marion, Martin, Montgomery, Noble, Orange, Parke, Pike, Posey, Pulaski, Ripley, StJoseph, Shelby
and Wells. Except for these counties with realigned street features, the 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files contain very few updates
to street features or address ranges from the Census 2000 versions of the TIGER/Line files.

ROADS_TIGER05_IN is a line shapefile of Indiana roads. Original data are from the U.S. Department of Commerce,
U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2005 (First Edition) Tiger Line Files.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

"The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER
database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area
based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries.  The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no
overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data
set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments
representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain information distributed over a series
of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate
points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in
the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types,
address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,
landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
To provide an updated road network of Indiana in a GIS format.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

"In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other
geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files."

"The TIGER/Line data are not in a mapping projection even though most of the features were scanned directly from source maps that were in a
projection.  To find out more about TIGER/Line files and other Census TIGER database derived data sets visit http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger.

TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database twice a year or when needed for geographic programs required to support the
census and survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau.  No changes or updates will be made to the 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files.  Future
releases of TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER database and will be released under a version numbering system
based on the month and year the data is extracted."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

"The Census Bureau uses Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates at road centerline intersections to evaluate the horizontal spatial
accuracy of source files that may be used to realign road features in the TIGER database and test the horizontal spatial accuracy of
the road features in the TIGER/Line files.  The test compares a survey-grade GPS coordinate to its associated road centerline
intersection in the TIGER file.  The test is based upon an independent collection of GPS coordinates for a random sample of
road intersections from a centerline file that meet certain criteria. The points are referred to as the sample points and are gathered
through a private contractor working for the Census Bureau.  Since the collection method uses survey-quality GPS-based field techniques,
the resulting control points are considered "ground truth" against which the TIGER road centerline intersection coordinates are compared.
The distances between the coordinates are calculated and the Census Bureau determines the Circular Error 95% (CE95).  That is, the accuracy
of the file in meters with 95% confidence.  The CE95 can be calculated from the mean and standard deviation by using the formula: mean of
differences plus (2.65 times the standard deviation). CE95 results reported for each file tested are determined using a
spreadsheet with embedded statistical formula.  The use and applicability of the spreadsheet and its embedded formula have been
verified by Census Bureau statisticians.  The basis of the calculation is the use of the root mean square error (RSME).  This is the method as
stated in the U.S. Government's Federal Geographic Data Committee Standard FGDC-STD-007.3-1998, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards.
Part 3: National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy. The results of using this measure of accuracy are in compliance with Federal Spatial
Data requirements.

In terms of the Census Bureau application, the dataset coordinate values are those taken from the centerline file and the coordinate values from
an independent source of higher accuracy are those acquired through the Census Bureau's contractor.

Please note that the horizontal spatial accuracy, where reported, refers only to the realigned road features identified as matched to the
positionally accurate source file with that accuracy.  It is not the spatial accuracy of the TIGER/Line file as a whole."

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN.SHP from INDOT personnel on September 13, 2006.
DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN.SHP was loaded into ESRI ArcMap and examined for completeness, attribute accuracy, and spatial
accuracy. IGS Personnel then deleted the following atttribute fields: "OBJECTID," "TRDS_," "TRDS_ID," "RT," "VERSION,"
"SIDE1," "FNODE_," "TNODE_," "LPOLY_," "RPOLY_," "LENGTH," "FRIADDL," "TOIADDL," "FRIADDR," "TOADDR," "AIANHHFPL,"

portions of the associated metadata provided by INDOT for DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN.SHP were extracted and included in this
metadata file.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ROADS_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

"The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features/entities;

Line Features -

(1) Roads

(2) Railroads

(3) Hydrography

(4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe lines

(5) Legal (governmental unit) and statistical boundaries

Landmark Features -

(1) Point landmarks, e.g., schools and churches; sporadic coverage added on an as-needed basis

(2) Area landmarks, e.g., Parks and cemeteries; sporadic coverage added on an as-needed basis

Polygon features -

(1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census 2000 census statistical data and governmental
unit boundaries legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS)

(2) Locations of area landmarks

The line features and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data/attributes
describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable
characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic entity codes.

The Census Bureau includes landmark features on an as-needed-basis and has made no attempt to ensure that all instances of
a particular landmark feature were included. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features
and provide locational reference. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature Landmarks may overlap or refer to
the same set of polygons.

The Census TIGER database uses collections of spatial objects (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world
geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, rivers, and political
boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market
Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
