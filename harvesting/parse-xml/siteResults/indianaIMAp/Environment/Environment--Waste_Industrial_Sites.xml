WASTE_INDUSTRIAL_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains industrial waste site locations in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana
Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of August 16, 2002 and subsequently updated on January 14, 2003,
July 11, 2003, June 3, 2004, January 4, 2005, April 25, 2005, July 27, 2006, January 24, 2007, June 4, 2009, April 16, 2010, June 25, 2013, and
February 25, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named INDUSTRIAL_WASTE.
WASTE_INDUSTRIAL_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identification numbers, federal identification numbers, and addresses. Facility information
and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Industrial Waste Section, Compliance and Response Branch, Office of Land Quality,
Indiana Department of Environmental Management.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source feature class INDUSTRIAL_WASTE:

"This project is the first phase in the creation of a base locational data set to establish Geographic Information Systems as
an intergral part of data management for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.  This set consists of known sites
with Industrial Waste. Industrial Waste Compliance GPS Points locate the entrance to facilities that generate and/or manage
hazardous waste, non-hazardous industrial waste, and solid waste. The majority of the points collected are Large Quantity
Generators (LQGs). Treatment Storage and Disposal facilities (TSDs) are also being collected. Occasionally, a Small Quantity
Generator (SQG) or Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) GPS points may be collected if the location has
significant environmental issues.

GPS data is collected, with portable GPS equipment, by Industrial Waste Compliance staff during scheduled compliance
Inspections. GPS points may also be logged at nearby LQGs when the compliance inspector is conducting other compliance
work in the area.

TSD - Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility is a facility that may treat, store, and /or dispose hazardous waste. The facility
is usually also a generator of hazardous waste.

LQG - Large Quantity Generator is a facility that generates more than 1,000 Kilograms (2,200lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.

SQG - Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 1,000 Kilograms (2,000 lbs.) but more than 100 Kilograms
(220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.

CESQG - Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous
waste per month.

Industrial Waste site inspectors were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems.  Trained staff then went
into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites.  This information was then brought back to the office, processed,
and QA/QC'd before being deposited in a central archive."

Department of Environmental Management.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
This data set generally contains the location of access points to managed sites, along with a unique identifier for each
location. Also included are Method, Accuracy, Description codes (MAD codes) for each entry.

"All attributes created during the process were verified by displaying the lines in the database and verifying consistency.
However, no formal tests were performed. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values in
certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as
the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field with the ommission was not relative to

"This data consists of locations of Industrial Waste Sites in Indiana. This data set contains information that represents what had
been recorded, processed, and archived by IDEM personnel at a time previous to publication. However the data set may be incomplete
and/or inaccurate due to the ever-changing status of managed facilities and sites, and due to the data collection and processing
efforts of IDEM staff. It is an ever-changing work in progress. Data were collected by the Industrial Waste Section within the
Office of Land Quality, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The Industrial Waste section was also responsible
for collecting attribute information for each location. The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no formal tests were performed
on accuracy. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values in certain fields is due to the fact

This data set was provided by IDEM personnel and is assumed to be accurate.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile INDUSTRIAL_WASTE:

"The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system and geocoding (address matching). The accuracy of the coordinates for
GPS data should be from .5-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment (ie., multipath,
SNR, and PDOP), and the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy cannot be guraranteed or verified.
Each GPS unit should have been configured within the specifications of the manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field
personnel would configure the unit outside of specifications if environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by
logging both Maximum PDOP and the standard deviations of the positional averagew of each location collected. If maximum PDOP
value was 6, the value for the In_specs field was input as "NO". If the standard deviation was 8, the corrected GPS file was
analyzed for signs of multipaty and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the archive, the In-specs
field was changed to "NO" and the location could have an accuracy 5 meters. Accuracy of address matching is unknown
at this time.
If the environmental conditions for the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection as defined by the
technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then the accuracy of the collected
coordinates should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5
meters (post-processed), the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of .50cm - 1m differential accuracy to real-time differential
correction.
If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those given by the
manufacturer."
</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>
The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less accurate than horizontal accuracy. The vertical accuracy for
these locations could have up to 15 meters of error. However, this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values
have been recorded, but it is strongly suggested that the values not be used for any analysis. Due to the nature of how these values are
derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large enough to make the coordinate values unusable in any type of locational analysis.

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named INDUSTRIAL_WASTE from IDEM personnel on August, 16, 2002. INDUSTRIAL_WASTE
was loaded into ESRI ArcView 3.3 and the following columns were deleted from the associated attribute table: LONGITUDE,
LATITUDE, HAE, METHOD, IN_SPECS, MAX_PDOP, CORR_TYPE, RCVR_TYPE, GPS_DATE, GPS_TIME, DATAFILE, UNFILT_POS,
STD_DEV, GENERATOR, and C_INITIAL. The shapefile was also visually checked to insure that all data points provided actually fell
within the accepted IGS state boundary. IGS personnel then saved the edited shapefile WASTE_INDUSTRIAL_IDEM_IN to follow
internal naming conventions.
It should also be noted that portions of the associated metadata provided by IDEM for INDUSTRIAL_WASTE was extracted and included
in this metadata file.

from IDEM personnel (Shane Moore) on July 11, 2003. The shapefile was visually checked to insure that all data points
provided actually fell within the accepted IGS state boundary. IGS personnel then saved the edited shapefile as
WASTE_INDUSTRIAL_IDEM_IN to follow internal naming conventions.
