Managed_Lands_IDNR_IN is an Esri polygon shapefile that contains managed land areas in Indiana, provided by personnel of the Indiana
Natural Heritage Data Center, Indiana Department of Natural Resources (INHDC-IDNR) as of February 12, 2018. Attributes include contact
information for land managers, as well as whether the land is open to the general public or if access is restricted. For additional
information regarding lands owned by federal agencies, local agencies, and non-profit organizations, as well as conservation
easements, persons should contact the IDNR Indiana Natural Heritage Data Center (317-232-4052).

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INHDC-IDNR for the source shapefile MANAGEDLANDS_DNR_INHD_IN_180212.SHP:

"ManagedLands_DNR_INHD_IN is a subset of ManagedLandsAll_DNR_INHD_IN, excluding those areas that are listed as conservation
easements or listed as closed.

"ManagedLandsAll_DNR is the Indiana Natural Heritage Data Center Managed Areas dataset. It includes natural and recreation areas
which are owned or managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, federal agencies, local agencies, and non-profit
organizations. It also includes private lands with Conservation Easements owned by IDNR.

"NATURAL AREAS THAT ARE NOT OWNED NOR MANAGED BY DNR ARE ADDED AS DATA IS AVAILABLE. IT IS BY NO MEANS A COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE
DATASET FOR ALL SUCH AREAS IN THE STATE.

"The Indiana Natural Heritage Data Center Managed Area Database is a digital, geospatial file containing information on Indiana's
significant protected natural areas. All counties in the state are represented."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
To provide the locations of lands owned or managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources as a GIS layer.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INHDC-IDNR for the source shapefile MANAGEDLANDS_DNR_INHD_IN_180212.SHP:

"This file was created as a statewide inventory of significant natural areas"
</purpose>

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INHDC-IDNR for the source shapefile MANAGEDLANDS_DNR_INHD_IN_180212.SHP:

Natural Heritage Data Center has data use agreements. Efforts are made to keep the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources lands up-to-date. Other organization owned lands are updated whenever information is made available to the
Department, so should be verified by those organizations as to its accurateness and completeness."

Updates to original dataset: increase to 1,700 labeled polygons. Most additions were local parks with LWCF funds attached to them. Data from deed record
maps (Div. of Engineering) were drawn on USGS Topologic maps and digitized adding to previously existing Managed Areas Database. Process was done by
