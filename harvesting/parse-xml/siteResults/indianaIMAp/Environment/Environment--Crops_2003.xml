The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set IN03NASS.TIF:

"The USDA-NASS 2003 Indiana Cropland Data Layer is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced
using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)
on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between the dates of April 11, 2003 and August 26, 2003. The approximate scale
is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The Indiana data layer is aggregated to 13 standardized
categories for display purposes with the emphasis being agricultural land cover.

This is part of an annual series in which several states are categorized annually based on the extensive field
observations collected during the annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. However, no farmer reported data is included
or derivable on the Cropland Data Layer CD-ROM."

      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set IN03NASS.TIF:

"The purpose of the Cropland Data Layer Program is to use satellite imagery on an annual basis to (1) provide supplemental
acreage estimates for the state's major commodities and (2) produce digital, crop specific, categorized geo-referenced
output products.

These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state level. The cropland data layers are provided
"as is". USDA/NASS does not warrant results you may obtain using the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set IN03NASS.TIF:

"PEDITOR is used as the NASS' main image processing software. PEDITOR has been maintained in-house and contains much of
the functionality available in commercial image processing systems. However, program/process modifications are relatively
easy to support in a research type environment, and the development/release cycle is faster. PEDITOR is deployed in all
participating NASS State Statistical Field Offices to handle the ground truthing process and all image processing tasks,
and is continuously tested with the Spatial Analysis Research Section (SARS) in Fairfax, Virginia. Currently, PEDITOR runs
on most Microsoft Windows platforms; however, PEDITOR's batch processing system programs only runs under Windows NT
or 2000.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set IN03NASS.TIF:

"Due to the extensiveness of the attribute accuracy report, the accuracy metadata is published on the
CD-ROM in an html format. NASS reports the Analysis District coverage, sensors used, percent correct and
kappa coefficients, regression analysis by Analysis District, the sampling frame scheme, and the
original cover type signatures.

Classification accuracy is generally between 85% to 95% correct for agricultural-related land cover
categories.

NASS collects the remote sensing Acreage Estimation Program's field level training data during the June
Agricultural Survey. This is a national survey based on a stratified random sample of land areas selected
from each state's area frame. An area frame is a land use stratification based on percent cultivation. Our
enumerators are given questionnaires to ask the farmers what, where, when and how much are they planting.
Our surveys focus on cropland, but the enumerators record all land covers within the sampled area of land
whether it is cropland or not. NASS uses broad land use categories to define land that is not under
cultivation, including; non-agricultural, pasture/rangeland, waste, woods, and farmstead. NASS defines these
non-agricultural land use types very broadly, which makes it difficult to precisely know what specific type
of land use/cover actually is on the ground. For instance, there is no breakdown as to the type of woods in
a given field/pasture, that's where the power of a GIS could be useful. If a external forestry GIS layer was
overlaid, the land use can be accurately identified, and the specific cover type can be derived from the
data layer. SARS is currently looking at creating extra categories for the enumerators to better identify
non-cropland features, thereby, increasing the accuracy and improving the appearance of the classification."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set IN03NASS.TIF:

"The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) Program provides the National Agricultural Statistics Service
(NASS) with internal proprietary county and state level acreage indications of major crop
commodities, and secondarily provides the public with "statewide" (where available) raster,
geo-referenced, categorized land cover data products after the public release of county estimates.
This project builds upon the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) traditional
crop acreage estimation program, and integrates the enumerator collected ground survey data with
satellite imagery to create an unbiased statistical estimator of crop area at the state and county
level for internal use. No farmer reported data is revealed, nor can it be derived in the publicly
releasable Cropland Data Layer product.

Every June thousands of farms are visited by enumerators as part of the USDA/NASS June Agricultural
Survey (JAS). These farmers are asked to report the acreage, by crop, that has been planted or that
they intend to plant, and the acreage they expect to harvest. Approximately 11,000 area segments are
selected nationwide for the JAS. The segment size can range in size from about 1 square mile in
cultivated areas to 0.1 of a square mile in urban areas, to 2-4 square miles for larger probability
proportional to size (PPS) segments in rangeland areas. This division allows intensively cultivated
land segments to be selected with a greater frequency than those in less intensively cultivated
areas. The 150-400 square miles of ground truth collected during the JAS provides a great ground
truth training set annually.

The Area Sampling Frame (ASF) is a stratification of each state into broad land use categories
according to the percentage of cropland present. The ASF is stratified using visual interpretation
of satellite imagery. The sampling frames are constructed by defining blocks of land whose
boundaries are physical features on the ground (roads, railroads, rivers, etc). These blocks of land
cover the entire state, do not overlap, and are placed in strata based on the percent of land in the
block that is cultivated. The strata allow for efficient sampling of the land, as an agriculturally
intensive area will be more heavily sampled than a non ag intensive area.

The enumerators draw off field boundaries onto NAPP 1:8,000 black and white aerial photos containing
the segment, according to their observations and the farmer reported information. The fields are
labeled and the cover type is recorded using a grease pencil on the aerial photo. Enumerators
account for every field/land use type within a segment. They assign each field a cover type based
upon a fixed set of land use classes for each state. Every field within a segment must fit into one
of the pre-defined classes.

The program methodology is a continuous process throughout the year. The first step "Segment
Preparation" establishes the training segments, digitizes the perimeters, and distributes software
and data to the field offices, this goes from February to late May. Segment digitizing begins
during the JAS and continues until all fields and all segments are completely digitized, this may
run thru July or even until mid-October in some states depending on human resource availability.
Segment cleanup analyzes the newly digitized segments with the new acquired imagery. Fields that are
bad either by digitizing or cover type are corrected or removed from training. Scene processing
fits each segment onto a scene by shifting, and cloud-influenced segments are removed. The
cluster/classification process runs in concert with the scene processing steps, as segments are
shifted they can be clustered. This process is iterative, and can run into December. Estimation can
be performed once a scene is finished classification, and the user is satisfied with the outputs.
Estimation can begin as early as late October and run into late January/February. The mosaic process
runs once estimation is completed. It is also iterative and can go from late December to March.
The mosaic for a particular state is released once the county estimates are officially released for
that state.

Scene selection begins in early summer, and could run into the late fall depending on image
availability. The Cropland Data Layer program primarily uses the Landsat platform for acreage
estimation. However, other platforms such as Spot and the Indian IRS platforms are used to fill
"data acquisition" holes within a state. A spring and summer date of observation is preferred for
maximum crop cover separation for multi-temporal analysis of summer crops. If only one date of
observation is available (unitemporal), a mid summer date is preferred. If only an early spring date
March-May or a fall date September-October is available (unitemporal) during the growing season,
then it is best to not use that scene or analysis district for estimation, as bare soil in the
spring and fully senesced crops in the fall will provide erroneous results.

The clustering/classification is an iterative process, as fields get misclassified, they can be
fixed or marked as bad for training and reprocessed. Known pixels are separated by cover type and
clustered, within cover type using a modified ISODATA clustering algorithm, as it allows for merging
and splitting of clusters. Modified implies that the output clusters are not labeled (other than as
coming from the input cover type) as they can be reassigned later if desired. Clustering is done
separately for each cover type (or specified combination of cover types, such as all small grains).
The clustered cover types are then assembled together into one signature file, where entire scenes
are classified using the maximum likelihood algorithm. Clustering is based on the LARSYS (Purdue
University) ISODATA algorithm. It performs an iterative process to divide pixels into groups based
on minimum variance. The pairs of clusters in close proximity (based on Swain-Fu distance) are
merged. High variance clusters can be split into two clusters (variance of first principal component
is used as a measure). The output of any clustering program is a statistics file which stores mean
vectors and covariance matrices of final set of clusters.

The outputs are a categorized or classified image in PEDITOR format and the associated accuracy
statistics for each cover type. The maximum likelihood classifier performs a pixel-by-pixel
classification based on the final, combined statistics file. It calculates the probability of each
pixel being from each signature; then classifies a pixel to the category with highest probability.
The processing time depends on size of file to be classified (i.e. number of pixels), number of
categories in the statistics file and number of input dimensions (number of bands/pixel).

For estimation purposes, clouds can be minimized by defining Analysis Districts (AD) along adjacent
scene edges, by cutting the Analysis Districts by county boundary, or cutting the clouds out by
primary sampling units. Analysis Districts can be individual or multiple scenes footprints that
have to be observed on the same date, and analyzed as one. An AD can be comprised of one or more
scenes. An AD can be defined by either a scene edge or a county boundary. Multi-temporal AD's are
possible as long as both dates in all scenes are the same. A single or multi-scene AD will use all
potential training fields for clustering/classification/estimation. Several factors can lead to
problems in a classification, some get corrected in early edits and some do not:

Several factors can lead to problems in a classification, some get corrected in early edits and
some do not: poor imagery dates, with respect to the major crops of interest, complete training
fields that are incorrectly identified in the ground truth, parts of training fields that are not
the same as the major crop or cover type, irrigation ditches, wooded areas, low spots filled with
water, and/or bare soil areas in an otherwise vegetated field. Crops that look alike to the
clustering algorithm(s) due to planting/growing cycle: spring wheat and barley at almost any time,
crops in senescence, and grassy waste fields and idle cropland. Cover types that are essentially the
same but used differently: wooded pasture versus woods or waste fields (only difference may be the
presence of livestock), corn for grain versus corn silage, and cover crops such as rye and oats.
Cover types that change signatures back and forth during the growing season: alfalfa and other hays
before and after cutting, with multiple cuttings per year. Once the analyst is satisfied with the
classification, the next step can be acreage estimation or image mosaicking.

Three estimation methods are available for each AD: regression, pixel ratio and direct expansion.
Where available, regression is chosen as the preferred type of estimation. This approach essentially
corrects the area sample (ground only) estimate based on the relationship found between reported
data and classified pixels in each stratum where it is used. A regression relationship should be
based on 10 or more segments for any stratum used. Where there are not enough segments in each
stratum, a pixel based ratio estimator may be used which essentially combines data across stratum to
get the relationship. Finally, the direct expansion (total number of possible segments times the
average for sampled segment) may be used in the absence of pixel based methods. Regression adjusts
the direct expansion estimate based on pixel information. It usually leads to an estimate with a
much lower variance than direct expansion alone. Segments, called outliers, which do not fit the
linear relationship estimated by the regression are reviewed; if errors are found, they are
corrected or that segment may be removed from consideration in the analysis.

Full scene classifications (large scale) are run wherever the regression or pixel ratio estimates
are usable. Estimates derived from the classification are compared to the ground data to make one
final check. State estimates are made by summing pixel based estimators where available and ground
data only estimators everywhere else. County estimates are then derived from the state estimates
using a similar approach. Final numbers are delivered to state field offices and the NASS
Agricultural Statistics Board for their use in setting the official final estimates. The states also
have administrative data, such as FSA certified acres at the county level, and other NASS survey
data. Every 5th year, NASS also performs the Census of Agriculture at the county level.

The Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes that SARS uses are radiometrically and systematically corrected. There is
a need to tie down registration points on a continuing basis for every state in the project. Without
some image/image registration, the scene registration tends to float 2-3 pixels in any given
direction, for any given scene. Manual registration for every scene of every project, would be
nearly impossible, as the CDL is on a repeating production cycle every year, and human resource
levels for this process are low. Image recoding is necessary between different analysis districts,
to rectify to a common signatures set for a state. Clouds pose a problem when trying to make acreage
estimates, and there are mechanisms within Peditor to minimize their extent, as there are ways to
minimize cloud coverage in the mosaic process by prioritizing scene overlap.

Each categorized scene is co-registered to EarthSat's GeoCover LC imagery (50 meters RMS), and then
stitched together using Peditor's Batch program. A block correlation is run between band two from
each raw scene, and band two of the ortho-base image. The registration of the GeoCover mosaicked
scene and the individual raw input scenes are used to get an approximate correspondence. A
correlation procedure is used on the raw Landsat scenes and the mosaicked scene to get an exact
mapping of each pixel from the input Landsat scenes to the mosaicked scene. The results of the
correlation are used to remap the pixels from the individual input scenes into the coordinate system
of the mosaicked scene. The mosaic process now performs: 1) Precision registration of images
automatically, 2) Converts each categorized image and associated statistics file to a set standard
automatically (recode), 3) Specify overlap priority by scene or county, 4) Filters out clouds when
possible. The scenes are stitched together using the priorities previously assigned from the scene
observation dates/analysis districts map. Scenes/analysis districts with better quality observation
dates are assigned a higher priority when stitching the images together. Clouds are assigned a null
value on all scenes, and scenes of lower priority that are cloud free, take precedence over clouded
higher priority images. Once cloud cover is established throughout the mosaic the clouds are
assigned a digital value.

The Cropland Data Layer CD-ROM products contain two years (if available) of imagery in a GEOTIFF
image file format. In order to maximize the visual contrast between different crops in various
states, colors that provide the best contrast for the crop mix in a particular State are chosen.
However, the digital values for each category within every State remain the same. So corn in ND
will have the same digital number as corn in AR. See mastercat.htm on the CDL CD-ROM in the statinfo
directory for a full listing by cover type.

All CDL distribution for the previous crop year is held until the release of the official NASS
county estimates for the major commodities grown within a given state. Corn and Soybeans are
released in March for the previous crop year - Midwestern States. Rice and Cotton are released in
June for the previous crop year - Delta States. Small grains are released in March for the Great
Plains States.

NASS publishes all available accuracy statistics for end-user viewing. The Percent Correct is
calculated for each cover type in the ground truth, it shows how many of the total pixels were
correctly classified (i.e. across all cover types). 'Commission Error' is the calculated percentage
of all pixels categorized to a specific cover type that were not of that cover type in the ground
truth (i.e. incorrectly categorized). CAUTION: a quoted Percent Correct for a specific cover type is
worthless unless accompanied by its respective Commission Error. Example: if you classify every
pixel in a scene to 'wheat', then you have a 100% correct wheat classifier (however its Commission
Error is also almost 100%). The 'Kappa Statistic' is an attempt to adjust the Percent Correct using
information gained from the confusion matrix for that cover type. Many remote sensing groups use
the Percent Correct and/or Kappa statistics as their final measure of classification accuracy.

The NASS CDL Program is continuing efforts to reduce end-user burden, increase functionality, and
take advantage of enhancements in computer technology. The Cropland Data Layer Program is a one of a
kind agricultural inventory program, where every state participating in the program is re-surveyed
(i.e., ground truthed) every June, and thus re-categorized. The data on the CD-ROM is in the public
domain, and you are free to do with it as you choose. NASS would appreciate acknowledgment or credit
regarding the source of the categorized images in any uses that you may have.

Remember, in no case is farmer reported data revealed or derivable from the public use Cropland Data
Layer CD-ROM's."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set IN03NASS.TIF:

"NASS collects the remote sensing Acreage Estimation Program's field level training data during the June
Agricultural Survey. This is a national survey based on a stratified random sample of land areas selected
from each state's area frame. An area frame is a land use stratification based on percent cultivation. The
selected areas are targeted toward cultivated parts of each state based on its area frame. Our enumerators
are given questionnaires to ask the farmers what, where, when and how much are they planting. Our surveys
focus on cropland, but the enumerators record all land covers within the sampled area of land whether it is
cropland or not. NASS uses broad land use categories to define land that is not under cultivation, including;
non-agricultural, pasture/rangeland, waste, woods, and farmstead. NASS defines these non-agricultural land use
types very broadly, which makes it difficult to precisely know what specific type of land use/cover actually
is on the ground. For instance, there is no breakdown as to the type of woods in a given field/pasture, that's
where the power of a GIS could be useful. If a external forestry GIS layer was overlaid, the land use can be
accurately identified, and the specific cover type can be derived from the data layer. SARS is currently
looking at creating extra categories for the enumerators to better identify non-cropland features, thereby,
increasing the accuracy and improving the appearance of the classification."
