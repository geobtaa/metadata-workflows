The source data set was obtained as a georeferenced TIFF image named "CDL_AWIFS_R_IN_2008.tif." The original data set
and its metadata are available on CD-ROM through the official NASS USDA Web site
&lt;http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm&gt;.

NOTE -- The georeferenced TIFF image named "cdl_awifs_r_in_2008.tif" that was created by the USDA is identical to the
georeferenced TIFF image named "CROPS_2008_USDA_IN.TIF" that is distributed by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS).
Only the filename and metadata have been modified to conform to IGS conventions.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_AWIFS_R_IN_2008.tif:

"The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer with a ground
resolution of 56 meters. The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Indian Remote Sensing RESOURCESAT-1 (IRS-P6)
Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) collected during the current growing season. Ancillary classification inputs include:
the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED), the USGS National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD 2001),
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 meter 16
day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites. Agricultural training and validation data are derived from the
Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) Program. The NLCD 2001 is used as non-agricultural training and validation data.
The strength and emphasis of the CDL is agricultural land cover. Please note that no farmer reported data are derivable from
the Cropland Data Layer."

      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_AWIFS_R_IN_2008.tif:

"The purpose of the Cropland Data Layer Program is to use satellite imagery to (1) provide acreage estimates to the
Agricultural Statistics Board for the state's major commodities and (2) produce digital, crop-specific, categorized geo-referenced
output products.

"These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state level. The cropland data layers are provided "as is."
USDA/NASS does not warrant results you may obtain using the data."

land cover classes within the Cropland Data Layer is entirely dependent upon the USGS, National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD 2001).
Thus, the USDA, NASS recommends that users consider the NLCD for studies involving non-agricultural land cover. For more
information on the accuracy of the NLCD please reference &lt;http://www.mrlc.gov/&gt;.

"Classification accuracy is generally between 85 [percent] to 95 [percent] correct for agricultural-related land cover categories."

"The AWiFS satellite imagery is purchased in an orthorectified and projected format. The Cropland Data Layer retains the
spatial attributes of the input AWiFS imagery.

"The AWiFS imagery used in the production of the Cropland Data Layer is purchased with an orthorectified level of processing.
Thus, the CDL will retain the input imagery's positional accuracy of 60 meters at the circular error at the 90 percent confidence
level (CE90). CE90 is a standard metric often used for horizontal accuracy in map products and can be interpreted as 90% of
well-defined points tested must fall within a certain radial distance."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_AWIFS_R_IN_2008.tif:

"OVERVIEW: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL)
Program is a unique agricultural-specific land cover geospatial product that is reproduced annually in participating states. The CDL
Program builds upon NASS' traditional crop acreage estimation program and integrates Farm Service Agency (FSA) grower-reported field data
with satellite imagery to create an unbiased statistical estimator of crop area at the state and county level for internal use. It is
important to note that the internal acreage estimates produced using the CDL are not simple pixel counting. It is more of an 'Adjusted
Census by Satellite.'

"SOFTWARE: Leica Geosystems ERDAS Imagine is used in the pre- and post- processing of all raster-based data. ESRI ArcGIS is used to prepare
the vector-based training and validation data. Rulequest See5.0 is used to create a decision tree based classifier. The NLCD Mapping Tool
is used to apply the See5.0 decision-tree via ERDAS Imagine.

"DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER: This Cropland Data Layer used the decision tree classifier approach. Using a decision tree classifier is a
departure from older versions of the CDL which were created using in-house software (Peditor) based upon a maximum likelihood classifier
approach. Check the 'Process Description' section of the specific state and year metadata file to verify the methodology used. Decision
trees offer several advantages over the more traditional maximum likelihood classification method. The advantages include being: 1) non-parametric
by nature and thus not reliant on the assumption of the input data being normally distributed, 2) efficient to construct and thus capable
of handling large and complex data sets, 3) able to incorporate missing and non-continuous data, and 4) able to sort out non-linear relationships.

"GROUND TRUTH: As with the maximum likelihood method, decision tree analysis is a supervised classification technique. Thus, it relies on having
a sample of known ground truth areas in which to train the classifier. Older versions of the CDL (prior to 2006) utilized ground truth data
from the annual June Agricultural Survey (JAS). Beginning in 2006, the CDL utilizes the very comprehensive ground truth data provided from the
FSA Common Land Unit (CLU) Program as a replacement for the JAS data. The FSA CLU data have the advantage of natively being in a GIS and
containing magnitudes more of field level information. Disadvantages include that it is not truly a probability sample of land cover and has
bias toward subsidized program crops. Additional information about the FSA data can be found at &lt;http://www.fsa.usda.gov/&gt;.

"INPUTS: The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Indian Remote Sensing RESOURCESAT-1 (IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS)
collected during the current growing season. NASS acquires AWiFS imagery for CDL production states from April 1 through September 30 of the
current growing season through a cooperative agreement with the USDA, Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), International Production Assessment
(IPA) unit. Ancillary inputs include; the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED), the USGS National Land
Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD 2001), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) 250 meter 16 day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites.

"ACCURACY: The accuracy of the land cover classifications are evaluated using independent validations data sets generated from the FSA CLU data
(agricultural categories) and the NLCD 2001 (non-agricultural categories). The Producer's Accuracy is generally 85% to 95% correct for the
major crop-specific land cover categories. See the 'Attribute Accuracy Report' section of this metadata file for the full accuracy report.
The official DVD contains additional accuracy assessment information that is not available through the Geospatial Data Gateway in the form
of an associated confidence layer. See the 'Attribute Accuracy Explanation' Section of this metadata file for more information on the
confidence layer.

"PUBLIC RELEASE: The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer is considered public domain and free to redistribute. The data is available on DVD for
the cost of reproduction through the official website at &lt;http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm&gt;. The data is also available
free for download through the Geospatial Data Gateway at &lt;http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/&gt;. See the 'Ordering Instructions' section of this

Used ESRI ArcGIS to project the image from WGS_194_UTM_Zone16N to NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_16N. Also exported the VAT file
from the original image and saved as an XLSX spreadsheet. Then joined the XLSX table to the newly projected image using
the attribute named "VALUE"  to populate the attribute field named "Class_Name." Then exported the joined image and data table
as a new image. Then edited the attribute table to delete duplicated fields, recalculated the Attribute field named "Opacity"
to "1" for all raster values with the exception of the background (where Value = 0). Using ERDAS Imagine 2010, exported this image
as a TIFF (direct read). In ArcGIS, imported the symbology from the original data, and exported the symbology as a new LYR file.
Renamed the file as Crops_2008_USDA_IN.TIF (with the new projection of NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_16N).
