PATOKA_RIVER_NWR_AREA_USFWS_IN is a polygon shapefile that depicts the
ownership status of lands within the acquirement boundary of Patoka
River National Wildlife Refuge, provided by Patoka River NWR.
Lands are classified as Federal (USFWS), State (Pike State Forest),
or Private.  Users should be aware that other state lands including more
tracts of the Pike State Forest and the Sugar Ridge Wildlife Management
Area adjoin or are near the refuge purchase boundary depicted. The
data set provided was in an ESRI shapefile format and was named Tract
Owners 83. This file was cleaned and reattributed by Bernardin,
Lochmueller &amp; Associates. The land within this shapefile is very near the
legislative boundary, "the boundary of potential federal land
acquisition", with only a small piece of USFWS owned land occurring
outside this delineation. Some areas owned by FWS are closed to hunting,
consult Patoka River NWR for information.  This file is not survey
quality.  Boundaries were placed using USGS DRGs and lines were sometimes
shifted (30-90 feet) to enable hardcopy presentation.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This dataset was compiled to provide locations and ownership status for
lands within the Patoka River NWR acquirement boundary.

The following is excerpted from Patoka River NWR metadata -

"It is specifically not intended to be used as a land survey or
representation of land for conveyance or tax purposes."

Tract data from an Rbase database file that was used
in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process 1991 to 1994.  The
file was converted to ArcView sometime in 1997.  Boundaries were drawn
using USGS DRG files for guideance.  Through time this file has been
updated and projected as necessary.

In order to correct known topological errors
including overlaps and unsnapped boundaries, Bernardin, Lochmueller &amp;
Associates created a new polygon shapefile by carefully tracing, at high
resolution, the polygons of Tract Owners 83.  Logical consistency
problems (overlaps, snapping, and multi-polygon records) were corrected,
however, no attempts were made to correct horizontal position, as it was
determined that to do so without sufficient independent information on
boundaries would degrade the integrity of the file. Inholding83 was used
to cut out known inholdings within refuge property.  Aquired83 and
State83 were used to check the ownership attributes of the polygons.
Some of Tract Owners 83 polygons were cut to reflect current ownership
status. The ESRI ArcView 3.2 Geoprocessing extention, Dissolve function
was then used to dissolve multiple, adjoining polygons with the same
ownership status into a single polygon, eliminating the tract boundary
lines, but still reflecting land ownership status.

Periodic updates on new land aquisition were sent to Bernardin, Lochmueller &amp; Associates from
Patoka NWR as needed since the creation of the March 2005 file.  These updates
consisted of an email description of the tract purchased and its acreage, along
with any notes of interest.  These tracts identified in the updates were found
in the Patoka Tracts files and then mereged into the federal ownership to create
an updated land ownership file.  Parcels with adjoining boundaries were unioned
to create a single "federal ownership" polygon.  The January 2006 updated
"Acquired 83" file was used to check the position of updates and enter the
purchase of tract 142 (8 ac) along with some adjoining acreage.  The following
tracts were added as federal ownership in the updated file - Tract 262 (Ferguson)
(sent December 2005), tracts 59, 75, and 59a (sent January 2006), tracts 142 (8 ac)
and 236 (6 ac) (sent March 2006), tract 77 (19.6 ac) (sent December 2006), and tract
169 (4 ac) (sent (February 2007).
