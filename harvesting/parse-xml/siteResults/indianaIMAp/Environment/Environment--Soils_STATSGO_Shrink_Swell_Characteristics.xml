The 1994 State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database for Indiana, obtained
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS),
was used to create SOILS_STATSGO_SHRINK_SWELL_IN showing the shrink-swell characteristics
of soils in Indiana.
The most restrictive shrink-swell characteristic of the soil layer was used to
represent the component soil. The component soil values were then
assigned to a map unit based on the percentage of that component soil
in the map unit. A category was calculated for the map unit based on the
most restrictive category at the 70th percentile of the map unit.

All classification percentages in this shapefile were derived from the STATSGO database.
The following statement is derived from the STATSGO metadata:
"Attribute accuracy is tested by
manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or
symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer
graphic system.  Selected attributes that cannot be visually
verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and
verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested
against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data
conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification
and correlation document and amendments and are current as of
the date of digitizing."

The following statement is derived from the STATSGO metadata:
"Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain
relationships are collected or generated to satisfy
topological requirements.  (The GT-polygon corresponds
to the soil delineation).  Some of these requirements
include:  chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not
extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are
defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout,
and the chains representing the limits of the file (neatline)
are free of gaps.  The tests of logical consistency are
performed using vendor software.  The neatline is generated by
connecting the explicitly entered four corners of the digital
file.  All data outside the enclosed region are ignored and
all data crossing these geographically straight lines are
clipped at the neatline.  Data within a specified tolerance of
the neatline are snapped to the neatline.  Neatline
straightening aligns the digitized edges of the digital data
with the generated neatline (i.e., with the longitude/latitude
lines in geographic coordinates).  All internal polygons are
tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on
hard copy plots.  All data are checked for common soil lines
(i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label).  Quadrangles
are edge-matched within the state, merged into a statewide
data set, and then edge-matched to adjacent state data sets.
Edge locations do not deviate from centerline to centerline by
more than 0.01 inches."

The following statement is derived from the STATSGO metadata:
"A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the
same in terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas.  Each
map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey
area and is uniquely identified.  Each individual area is
a delineation.  Each map unit consists of one to 21 components.

In those few areas where detailed maps did not exist,
reconnaissance soil surveys were combined with data on
geology, topography, vegetation, climate, and remote sensing
images to delineate map units and estimate the percentages of
components.  The STATSGO map unit components are soil series
phases, and their percent composition represents the estimated
areal proportion of each within STATSGO map unit.  The
composition for a map unit is generalized to represent the
statewide extent of that map unit and not the extent of any
single map unit delineation.  These specifications provide a
nationally consistent representation of STATSGO attribute
data.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on statistical analysis of transect
data.  The composition was largely determined by measuring
transects on detailed soil survey maps.  The number of
transects used was proportional to the relative size, number,
and complexity of the delineations.  The combined data on the
length of the map units crossed by the transects were used to
determine the percentages of the different soil and nonsoil
areas in each map unit.

Specific limits were established on the classification of
soils and the design and name of map units.  These limits are
outlined in U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1975. Soil
Taxonomy: A basic system of soil classification for making and
interpreting soil surveys. Soil Conserv. Serv., U.S. Dep.
Agric. Handb. 436.; U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1992. Keys

Agriculture. 1993. Soil Survey Manual. Soil Surv. Staff, U.S.
Dep. Agric. Handbook 18.

Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards
and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and
quality assurance.  Quality control is outlined in documents
that reside with the Soil Conservation Service state soil
scientist."

The following statement is derived from the STATSGO metadata:
"The accuracy of these digital
data is based upon their compilation to base
maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards.  The
difference in positional accuracy between the map unit
boundaries in the field and their digitized map locations
is unknown.  The locational accuracy of soil delineations on
the ground varies with the transition between map units.
For example, in areas where changes in soils, climate,
topography, and geology occur subtly across a portion of a
state, the transition between soil map unit boundaries will
be gradual.  Where these features change abruptly, such as
from an area of foothills to a lake plain, the transition
will be very narrow.  Soil delineation boundaries were
digitized within 0.01 inches of their locations on the
digitizing source.  The digital map elements are edge
matched between data sets.  The data along each state
boundary are matched against the data for the adjacent
state.  Edge locations generally do not deviate from
centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch."

1) The STATSGO information was projected from the Albers projection to UTM zone 16
NAD83 using ESRI ArcInfo v 8.1.
2) Data from the STATSGO data set were processed to determine the most restrictive shrink-swell
characteristic soil layer in a component soil. The percentage of that component soil in the map
unit was then calculated and the sum of the component soils per map unit was determined.
The summary totals for each map unit were added together beginning with the most restrictive
and proceeding to the least restrictive. The category that was assigned to each map unit was
determined based on the category where the cumulative percentage reached the 70th percentile
level. The shapefile named "SHRINK-SWELL" was produced.

SHRINK-SWELL.SHP was converted to a temporary ESRI ArcInfo 8.1 coverage, named "SHRINK-SWELL", for processing.
The coverage was then clipped to another coverage, INCLP83, containing the area within the 92 county
boundaries for the state of Indiana, which was compiled at a scale of 1:24,000. Since SHRINK-SWELL and
INCLP83 boundaries did not coincide perfectly with one another, some polygons along the state boundary
were either slightly truncated or slightly extended to the new boundary.  In every case, the modifications
were minor. The coverage was then converted to a shapefile format, named "SOILS_STATSGO_SHRINK_SWELL_IN",
using ESRI ArcView 3.2.
