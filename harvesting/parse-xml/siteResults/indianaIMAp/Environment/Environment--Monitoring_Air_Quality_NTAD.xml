Polygons in this shapefile indicate areas in Indiana designated as non-attainment for ozone and (or) PM-2.5; or maintenance
for ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, and (or) PM-10. Non-attainment area is any area that does not meet (or that
contributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the national primary or secondary ambient air
quality standard (NAAQ) for the pollutant. Maintenance areas are areas which were previously non-attainment (did not meet
national ambient air quality (NAAQ) standards for the pollutant) but have now been designated attainment (now meeting the
standards).  These areas must have a maintenance plan outlining steps to maintain air quality and control measures to
improve air quality that will remain in place. The maintenance plan must demonstrate continued compliance, considering
projected growth, for a period of ten years. If outdoor air monitors record a violation of the standard, the maintenance
plan includes a commitment to determine appropriate measures to address the cause of the violation. NAAQS are often referred
to as federal health standards for outdoor air. More information on air attainment can be found from the Indiana Department
of Environmental Management, Office of Air Quality, Air Attainment web site at
http://www.in.gov/idem/programs/air/attainment/index.html.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
To provide the boundaries of each non-attainment and maintenance area in Indiana for carbon monoxide, lead, sulfur
dioxide, PM-10, PM-2.5, and ozone.

"Code of the Federal Regulations -  Title 40, Part 50 lists the ambient air quality standards."

CARBON MONOXIDE

"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless and poisonous gas produced by incomplete burning
of carbon in fuels. When CO enters the bloodstream, it reduces the delivery of oxygen to the body's
organs and tissues. Health threats are most serious for those who suffer from cardiovascular disease,
particularly those with angina or peripheral vascular disease. Exposure to elevated CO levels can cause
impairment of visual perception, manual dexterity, learning ability and performance of complex tasks.

"77% of the nationwide CO emissions are from transportation sources. The largest emissions contribution
comes from highway motor vehicles. Thus, the focus of CO monitoring has been on traffic oriented sites in
urban areas where the main source of CO is motor vehicle exhaust. Other major CO sources are wood-burning
stoves, incinerators and industrial sources.

"The National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQs) for carbon monoxide is 9 ppm 8-hour non-overlapping average not to be
exceeded more than once per year. The rounding convention in the standard specifies that values of 9.5 ppm, or
greater, are counted as exceeding the level of the standard. An area meets the carbon monoxide NAAQS if no more
than one 8-hour value per year exceeds the threshold. (High values that occur within 8 hours of the first one are
exempted. This is known as using "non-overlapping averages.") To be in attainment, an area must meet the NAAQS for
two consecutive years and carry out air quality monitoring during the entire time. Air quality carbon monoxide value
is estimated using EPA guidance for calculating design values (Laxton Memorandum, June 18, 1990).

"Sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186 of the Clean Air Act lists the requirements for designations and classifications of carbon monoxide areas."

LEAD

"Exposure to lead (Pb) can occur through multiple pathways, including inhalation of air and ingestion of Pb
in food, water, soil or dust. Excessive Pb exposure can cause seizures, mental retardation and/or behavioral
disorders. A recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported a 78% decrease in blood lead
levels from 12.8 to 2.8 ug/dL between 1976 and 1980 and from 1988 to 1991. This dramatic decline can be attributed
to the reduction of leaded gasoline and to the removal of lead from soldered cans. Although this study shows great,
infants and young children are especially susceptible to low doses of Pb, and this age group still shows
the highest levels. Low doses of Pb can lead to central nervous system damage. Recent studies have also shown that
Pb may be a factor in high blood pressure and in subsequent heart disease in middle-aged males.

"Lead gasoline additives, non-ferrous smelters, and battery plants are the most significant contributors to atmospheric
Pb emissions. In 1993 transportation sources contributed 33% of the annual emissions, down substantially from 81% in
1985. Total Pb emissions from all sources dropped from 20,100 tons in 1985 to 4,900 tons in 1993. The decrease in Pb
emissions from highway vehicles accounts for essentially all of this decline. The reasons for the decrease are noted below.

"Two air pollution control programs implemented by EPA before promulgation of the Pb standard in October 1978 have resulted
in lower ambient Pb levels. First, regulations issued in the early 1970's required gradual reduction of the Pb content of
all gasoline over a period of many years. The Pb content of the leaded gasoline pool was reduced from an average of 12.0
gram/gallon, to 0.5 gram/gallon on July 1, 1985, and still further to 0.1 gram/gallon on January 1, 1986. Second, as part
of the EPA's overall automotive emission control program, unleaded gasoline was introduced in 1975 for automobiles equipped
with catalytic control devices. These devices reduce emissions of CO, VOCs and NOx. In 1993, unleaded gasoline sales
accounted for 99% of the total gasoline market. In contrast, the unleaded share of the gasoline market in 1984 was
approximately 60%. These programs have essentially eliminated violations of the Pb standard in urban areas except
those areas with Pb point sources.

"Programs are also in place to control Pb emissions from stationary point sources. Lead emissions from stationary sources
have been substantially reduced by control programs oriented toward attainment of the PM-10 and Pb ambient standards. However,
significant and ambient problems still remain around some Pb point sources, which are now the focus of new monitoring initiatives.
Pb emissions in 1993 from industrial sources, e.g., primary and secondary Pb smelters, dropped by about 91% from levels reported
in 1970. Emissions of Pb from solid waste disposal are down about 76% since 1970. In 1993, emissions from solid waste disposal,
industrial processes and transportation were: 500, 2,300 and 1,600 short tons, respectively. The overall effect of the control
programs for these three categories has been a major reduction in the amount of Pb in the ambient air. Additional reduction in
Pb are anticipated as a result of the Agency's Multimedia Lead Strategy issued in February 1991. The goal of the Lead Strategy
is to reduce Pb exposures to the fullest extent practicable."

PM-10

"Air pollutants called particulate matter include dust, dirt, soot, smoke and liquid droplets directly
emitted into the air by sources such as factories, power plants, cars, construction activity, fires and
natural windblown dust. Particles formed in the atmosphere by condensation or the transformation of emitted
gases such as SO2 and VOCs are also considered particulate matter. Based on studies of human populations
exposed to high concentrations of particles (sometimes in the presence of SO2) and laboratory studies of
animals and humans, there are major effects of concern for human health. These include effects on breathing
and respiratory symptoms, aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease, alterations in the
body's defense systems against foreign materials, damage to lung tissue, carcinogenesis and premature death.
The major subgroups of the population that appear to be most sensitive to the effects of particulate matter
include individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary or cardiovascular disease or influenza, asthmatics,
the elderly and children. Particulate matter also soils and damages materials, and is a major cause of visibility
impairment in the United States.

"Annual and 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter were first set in 1971.
Total suspended particulate (TSP) was the first indicator used to represent suspended particles in the ambient air.
Since July 1, 1987, however, EPA has used the indicator PM-10, which includes only those particles with aerodynamic
diameter smaller than 10 micrometers. These smaller particles are likely responsible for most of the adverse health
effects of particulate matter because of their ability to reach the thoracic or lower regions of the respiratory tract."

SULFUR DIOXIDE

"High concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory
and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or
emphysema, children and the elderly. SO2 is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain,
which causes acidification of lakes and streams and can damage trees, crops, historic buildings and statues.
In addition, sulfur compounds in the air contribute to visibility impairment in large parts of the country.
This is especially noticeable in national parks.

"Ambient SO2 results largely from stationary sources such as coal and oil combustion, steel mills, refineries,
pulp and paper mills and from nonferrous smelters. There are three NAAQS for SO2: an annual arithmetic mean of 0.03 ppm (80 ug/m3),
a 24-hour level of 0.14 ppm (365 ug/m3), a 3-hour level of 0.50 ppm (1300 ug/m3).

"The first two standards are primary (health-related) standards, while the 3-hour NAAQS is a secondary (welfare-related)
standard. The annual mean standard is not to be exceeded, while the short-term standards are not to be exceeded more than
once per year."

OZONE

"Ozone (O3) is a photochemical oxidant and the major component of smog. While O3 in the upper
atmosphere is beneficial to life by shielding the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation
from the sun, high concentrations of O3 at ground level are a major health and environmental
concern. O3 is not emitted directly into the air but is formed through complex chemical reactions
between precursor emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the
presence of sunlight. These reactions are stimulated by sunlight and temperature so that peak O3 levels
occur typically during the warmer times of the year. Both VOCs and NOx are emitted by transportation
and industrial sources. VOCs are emitted from sources as diverse as autos, chemical manufacturing, dry
cleaners, paint shops and other sources using solvents.

"The reactivity of O3 causes health problems because it damages lung tissue, reduces lung function and
sensitizes the lungs to other irritants. Scientific evidence indicates that ambient levels of O3 not
only affect people with impaired respiratory systems, such as asthmatics, but healthy adults and children
as well. Exposure to O3 for several hours at relatively low concentrations has been found to significantly
reduce lung function and induce respiratory inflammation in normal, healthy people during exercise. This
decrease in lung function generally is accompanied by symptoms including chest pain, coughing, sneezing
and pulmonary congestion."

PM-2.5

"Air pollutants called particulate matter include dust, dirt, soot, smoke and liquid droplets directly
emitted into the air by sources such as factories, power plants, cars, construction activity, fires and
natural windblown dust. Particles formed in the atmosphere by condensation or the transformation of emitted
gases such as SO2 and VOCs are also considered particulate matter. Based on studies of human populations
exposed to high concentrations of particles (sometimes in the presence of SO2) and laboratory studies of
animals and humans, there are major effects of concern for human health. These include effects on breathing
and respiratory symptoms, aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease, alterations in the
body's defense systems against foreign materials, damage to lung tissue, carcinogenesis and premature death.
The major subgroups of the population that appear to be most sensitive to the effects of particulate matter
include individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary or cardiovascular disease or influenza, asthmatics,
the elderly and children. Particulate matter also soils and damages materials, and is a major cause of visibility
impairment in the United States.

"Annual and 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter were first set in 1971.
Total suspended particulate (TSP) was the first indicator used to represent suspended particles in the ambient
air. Particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are referred to as "fine" particles and are believed
to pose the largest health risks. Because of their small size (less than one-seventh the average width of a human
hair), fine particles can lodge deeply into the lungs."

The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) "Green Book" defines
criteria pollutants.  EPA uses six "criteria pollutants" as indicators of air quality, and has
established for each of them a maximum concentration above which adverse effects on human health may
occur. These threshold concentrations are called National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

"NAA_MA_PM10.SHP", AND "NAA_MA_SOX.SHP" were downloaded May 2007 from the web site for the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Databases (NTAD).

http://www.bts.gov/programs/geographic_information_services/

For each source file, A subset file was then created for only those polygons with "IN" in State fields.
Data were transformed to UTM Zone 16 NAD 83, meters. Some fields were deleted because of redundant
or empty records.

Any areas that extended beyond the state boundary were clipped to the state boundary.

A union process was run on the intermediate files for CO, lead, and PM-10.  The polygons were cleaned and
attributes were verified.  Polygons in the SOX file were then added with the same process.  The same
process was used to make a union file of PM-2.5 and Ozone.  The PM2.5_Ozone file was unioned to the
CO_Lead_PM10_SOX file to create a single file that contained all polygons for all pollutants. Polygons
were cleaned and attributes were checked as each new file was added to the final set. Fields were added
so that each pollutant and its status in each polygon can be differentiated, as well as any dates, status,
or notes unique to a single pollutant.
