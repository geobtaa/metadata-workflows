The source data set was obtained as a georeferenced TIFF image named "CDL_2010_CLIP_20131230093625_434373848.tif." The original data set
and its metadata are available on CD-ROM through the official NASS USDA Web site referred to as "CropScape" &lt;http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/&gt;.

NOTE -- The georeferenced TIFF image named "CDL_2010_CLIP_20131230093625_434373848.tif" that was created by the USDA is identical to the georeferenced TIFF image
named "CROPS_2010_USDA_IN.TIF" that is distributed by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). Only the filename and metadata have been modified to conform to IGS
conventions.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_2010_CLIP_20131230093625_434373848.tif:

"The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer. The 2010 CDL has a ground resolution of 30 meters.
The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 5 TM sensor, Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, and the Indian Remote Sensing RESOURCESAT-1 (IRS-P6) Advanced
Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) collected during the current growing season.

"Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the classification. These additional sources can include the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED), the USGS National Land Cover Database 2001 (NLCD 2001), and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 meter 16 day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites.

"Agricultural training and validation data are derived from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) Program. The NLCD 2001 is used as non-agricultural
training and validation data. Please refer to the 'Supplemental_Information' Section of this metadata file for a complete list of all imagery, ancillary data, and
training/validation data used to generate this state's CDL. The strength and emphasis of the CDL is agricultural land cover. Please note that no farmer reported data
are derivable from the Cropland Data Layer."

"*NOTE: Correct Pixels represents the total number of independent validation pixels correctly identified in the error matrix.

"**NOTE: The Overall Accuracy represents only the FSA row crops and annual fruit and vegetables (codes 1-61 and 200-255).
FSA-sampled tree and shrub crops, aquaculture, and all NLCD-sampled categories (codes 62-199) are not included in the Overall Accuracy.

"***NOTE: The 1997-2010 CDLs were recoded and re-released in January 2012 to better align the historical CDL's with the current product. Most of these
category changes were in the non-agriculture domain. The only agricultural categories impacted are Other Tree Nuts (code 71), Other Tree Fruits (code 73),
Other Non-Tree Fruit (code 80), and Cucumbers (code 228). For a detailed list of the category name and code changes, please visit the Frequently Asked

"The accuracy of the non-agricultural land cover classes within the Cropland Data Layer is entirely dependent upon the USGS, National Land Cover Database
(NLCD 2001). Thus, the USDA, NASS recommends that users consider the NLCD for studies involving non-agricultural land cover. For more information on
the accuracy of the NLCD please reference &lt;http://www.mrlc.gov/&gt;.

"Classification accuracy is generally 85% to 95% correct for the major crop-specific land cover categories. See the 'Attribute Accuracy Report' section
of this metadata file for the detailed accuracy report.

"The strength and emphasis of the CDL is crop-specific land cover categories. The accuracy of the CDL non-agricultural land cover classes is entirely
dependent upon the USGS, National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001). Thus, the USDA, NASS recommends that users consider the NLCD for studies involving
non-agricultural land cover.

"These definitions of accuracy statistics were derived from the following book: Congalton, Russell G. and Kass Green. Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely
Sensed Data: Principles and Practices. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, Inc. 1999. The 'Producer's Accuracy' is calculated for each cover type in the ground
truth and indicates the probability that a ground truth pixel will be correctly mapped (across all cover types) and measures 'errors of omission'. An
'Omission Error' occurs when a pixel is excluded from the category to which it belongs in the validation dataset. The 'User's Accuracy' indicates the probability
that a pixel from the CDL classification actually matches the ground truth data and measures 'errors of commission'. The 'Commission Error' represent when a pixel
is included in an incorrect category according to the validation data. It is important to take into consideration errors of omission and commission. For example,
if you classify every pixel in a scene to 'wheat', then you have 100% Producer's Accuracy for the wheat category and 0% Omission Error. However, you would also
have a very high error of commission as all other crop types would be included in the incorrect category. The 'Kappa' is a measure of agreement based on the
difference between the actual agreement in the error matrix (i.e., the agreement between the remotely sensed classification and the reference data as indicated
by the major diagonal) and the chance agreement which is indicated by the row and column totals. The 'Conditional Kappa Coefficient' is the agreement for an
individual category within the entire error matrix."

"The Cropland Data Layer retains the spatial attributes of the input imagery. The Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM imagery was obtained via

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_2010_CLIP_20131230093625_434373848.tif:

"OVERVIEW: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL)
Program is a unique agricultural-specific land cover geospatial product that is reproduced annually in participating states. The CDL
Program builds upon NASS' traditional crop acreage estimation program and integrates Farm Service Agency (FSA) grower-reported field data
with satellite imagery to create an unbiased statistical estimator of crop area at the state and county level for internal use. It is
important to note that the internal acreage estimates produced using the CDL are not simple pixel counting. It is more of an 'Adjusted
Census by Satellite.'

"SOFTWARE: ERDAS Imagine is used in the pre- and post- processing of all raster-based data. ESRI ArcGIS is used to prepare
the vector-based training and validation data. Rulequest See5.0 is used to create a decision tree based classifier. The NLCD Mapping Tool
is used to apply the See5.0 decision-tree via ERDAS Imagine.

"DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER: This Cropland Data Layer used the decision tree classifier approach. Using a decision tree classifier is a
departure from older versions of the CDL which were created using in-house software (Peditor) based upon a maximum likelihood classifier
approach. Check the 'Process Description' section of the specific state and year metadata file to verify the methodology used. Decision
trees offer several advantages over the more traditional maximum likelihood classification method. The advantages include being: 1) non-parametric
by nature and thus not reliant on the assumption of the input data being normally distributed, 2) efficient to construct and thus capable
of handling large and complex data sets, 3) able to incorporate missing and non-continuous data, and 4) able to sort out non-linear relationships.

"GROUND TRUTH: As with the maximum likelihood method, decision tree analysis is a supervised classification technique. Thus, it relies on having
a sample of known ground truth areas in which to train the classifier. Older versions of the CDL (prior to 2006) utilized ground truth data
from the annual June Agricultural Survey (JAS). Beginning in 2006, the CDL utilizes the very comprehensive ground truth data provided from the
FSA Common Land Unit (CLU) Program as a replacement for the JAS data. The FSA CLU data have the advantage of natively being in a GIS and
containing magnitudes more of field level information. Disadvantages include that it is not truly a probability sample of land cover and has
bias toward subsidized program crops. Additional information about the FSA data can be found at &lt;http://www.fsa.usda.gov/&gt;.

"INPUTS: The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 5 TM sensor, Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, and the Indian Remote Sensing RESOURCESAT-1
(IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) collected during the current growing season. Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and
ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the classification. These additional sources can include the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National
Elevation Dataset (NED), the USGS National Land Cover Database 2001 (NLCD 2001), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 meter 16 day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites. Please refer to the
'Supplemental_Information' Section of this metadata file for a complete list of all imagery and ancillary data used to generate this state's CDL.

"ACCURACY: The accuracy of the land cover classifications are evaluated using independent validations data sets generated from the FSA CLU data
(agricultural categories) and the NLCD 2001 (non-agricultural categories). The Producer's Accuracy is generally 85% to 95% correct for the
major crop-specific land cover categories. See the 'Attribute Accuracy Report' section of this metadata file for the full accuracy report.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_2010_CLIP_20131230093625_434373848.tif:

"The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is produced using agricultural training data from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land
Unit (CLU) Program and non-agricultural training data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Land Cover Dataset
2001 (NLCD 2001). The strength and emphasis of the CDL is crop-specific land cover categories. The accuracy of the CDL non-agricultural
land cover classes are entirely dependent upon the NLCD. Thus, the USDA, NASS recommends that users consider the NLCD for studies
involving non-agricultural land cover."
