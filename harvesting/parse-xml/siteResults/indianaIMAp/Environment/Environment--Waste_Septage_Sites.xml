WASTE_SEPTAGE_SITES_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains septage waste site locations in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department
of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of July 11, 2003 and was subsequently updated on June 3, 2004, January 4, 2005,
April 25, 2005, July 27, 2006, January 24, 2007, June 4, 2009, October 20, 2009, April 16, 2010, and June 25, 2013. The data set provided by IDEM was
in an ESRI geodatabsae format and the feature class was named "SEPTAGE." WASTE_SEPTAGE_SITES_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility names and federal
identification numbers.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SEPTAGE:

"This dataset consists of Septage Sites - permitted septage (septic tank waste) sites where the waste is land applied, as defined by 327 IAC 7,
327 IAC 7-6, and 327 IAC 7-7 of the Indiana Administrative Code."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This data set was developed to provide accurate coordinate information for managed facilities and customers of the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SEPTAGE:

"This data set contains the locations of access points to managed sites, along with a unique identifier for each location. In a few instances other features
were used as a reference for the location of the managed sites. Also included are method, accuracy, description codes (metadata) for each entry."

This data set was provided by IDEM personnel and is assumed to be accurate.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SEPTAGE:

"All attributes created during the process were verified by displaying the lines in the database and verifying consistency.
However, no formal tests were performed.  Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Omissions or null values in
certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as
the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field with the ommission was not relative to
the method used to collect the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SEPTAGE:

"This data set consists of locations of Septage Sites within the state of Indiana.  This dataset
is incomplete and a work in progress, as sites are GPS'd as they are inspected.  This dataset contains
information that represents what had been recorded, processed, and archived by IDEM personnel at a time
previous to publication.  However the data set may be incomplete and/or inaccurate due to the
ever-changing status of managed facilities and sites, and due to the data collection and processing efforts of IDEM staff.
It is an ever-changing work in progress.  Data were collected by the Solid Waste Compliance section within
the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The Section was also responsible
for collecting attribute information for each location. The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no
formal tests were performed on accuracy.  Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Omissions or
null values in certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or
deleting attribute information) as the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out,
or the field with the ommission was not relative to the method used to collect the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SEPTAGE:

"The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system. The accuracy of the
coordinates should be from 1-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment
(ie., multipath, SNR, and PDOP), and the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy
cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Each GPS unit should have been configured within the specifications of the
manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field personnel would configure the unit outside of specifications if
environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by logging both Maximum PDOP and the standard deviations
of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value was &gt; 6, the value for the "In_specs"
field was input as "NO". If the standard deviation was &gt; 8, the corrected GPS file was analyzed for signs of
multipath and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the archive. If the data set was
uneditable it was still left in the archive.  The "In-specs" field was changed to "No" and the location could
have an accuracy &gt; 5 meters.

If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection as defined by the
technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then the accuracy of the collected coordinates
should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5 meters (post-processed),
the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters (post-processed), and the Pro XR has a range of .50 cm - 1m differential accuracy to
real-time differential correction.

If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those given by the
manufacturer."

      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SEPTAGE:

"The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less
accurate than horizontal accuracy. The vertical accuracy for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error.  However,
this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values have been recorded, but it is strongly
suggested that the values not be used for any analysis.

Due to the nature of how these values are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large enough
to make the coordinate values unuseable in any type of locational analysis."

IGS personnel received an updated ESRI geodatabase (and metadata) named "OLQ_GPS_DATA_IGS.MDB" from IDEM personnel
(Shane Moore) on April 25, 2005. OLQ_GPS_DATA_IGS.MDB was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.0 and the
subset of data containing septage waste site locations was exported to an ESRI shapefile format. The
shapefile was visually checked to insure that all data points provided actually fell within the accepted IGS
state boundary. The shapefile was then edited by removing the following fields from the associated attribute
table: HORIZONTAL, NORTHING, EASTING, STANDARD_D, LOCATION_A, POSTAL_COD and COUNTY_NAM. IGS personnel then
saved the edited shapefile as WASTE_SEPTAGE_SITES_IDEM_IN.SHP to follow internal naming conventions.

IGS personnel received an updated ESRI geodatabase (and metadata) named "GPSDATA_UPDATES.MDB" from IDEM personnel
(Shane Moore) on July 27, 2006. GPSDATA_UPDATES.MDB was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.0 and the
subset of data containing septage waste site locations were examined.
No changes in this dataset were apparent from the last update date on April 25, 2005 so only the metadata was
edited to reflect this information. No changes to the WASTE_SEPTAGE_SITES_IDEM_IN.SHP were made.

IGS personnel received an updated ESRI geodatabase (and metadata) named "OLQ IndianaMap Export-06012009.gdb" from IDEM personnel
(Shane Moore) on June 4, 2009. "OLQ IndianaMap Export-06012009.gdb" was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.3.1 and the
subset of data containing septage waste site locations were examined and exported to ESRI shapefile format.
The shapefile was then edited by removing the following fields from the associated attribute
table: HORIZONTAL, NORTHING, EASTING, STANDARD_D, LOCATION_A, POSTAL_COD and COUNTY_NAM. IGS personnel then
saved the edited shapefile as WASTE_SEPTAGE_SITES_IDEM_IN.SHP to follow internal naming conventions.
