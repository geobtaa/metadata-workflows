"The USDA-NASS 2006 Indiana Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using
satellite imagery from the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS). The AWiFS ground resolution is 56 meters by
56 meters. The imagery was collected between the dates of 04/22/2006 and 09/08/2006. The Indiana data layer is aggregated to a reduced
number of standardized categories for display purposes with the emphasis being agricultural land cover.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_AWIFS_R_IN_2006.tif:

"The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) Program provides the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) with internal proprietary county
and state level acreage indications of major crop commodities, and secondarily provides the public with 'statewide' (where available)
raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data products after the public release of county estimates. This project builds upon
NASS' traditional crop acreage estimation program, and integrates the enumerator collected ground survey data with satellite imagery
to create an unbiased statistical estimator of crop area at the state and county level for internal use. No farmer reported data is
revealed, nor can it be derived in the publicly releasable Cropland Data Layer product.

"Every June thousands of farms are visited by enumerators as part of the USDA/NASS June Agricultural Survey (JAS). These farmers are
asked to report the acreage, by crop, that has been planted or that they intend to plant, and the acreage they expect to harvest.
Approximately 11,000 area segments are selected nationwide for the JAS. The segment size can range in size from about 1 square mile in
cultivated areas to 0.1 of a square mile in urban areas, to 2-4 square miles for larger probability proportional to size (PPS) segments
in rangeland areas. This division allows intensively cultivated land segments to be selected with a greater frequency than those in
less intensively cultivated areas. The 150-400 square miles of ground truth collected during the JAS provides a great ground truth
training set annually.

"The Area Sampling Frame (ASF) is a stratification of each state into broad land use categories according to the percentage of cropland
present. The ASF is stratified using visual interpretation of satellite imagery. The sampling frames are constructed by defining blocks
of land whose boundaries are physical features on the ground (roads, railroads, rivers, etc). These blocks of land cover the entire
state, do not overlap, and are placed in strata based on the percent of land in the block that is cultivated. The strata allow for
efficient sampling of the land, as an agriculturally intensive area will be more heavily sampled than a non ag intensive area.

"The enumerators draw off field boundaries onto NAPP 1:8,000 black and white aerial photos containing the segment, according to their
observations and the farmer reported information. The fields are labeled and the cover type is recorded using a grease pencil on the
aerial photo. Enumerators account for every field/land use type within a segment. They assign each field a cover type based upon a
fixed set of land use classes for each state. Every field within a segment must fit into one of the pre-defined classes.

"The program methodology is a continuous process throughout the year.  The first step 'Segment Preparation' establishes the training
segments, digitizes the perimeters, and distributes software and data to the field offices, this goes from February to late May.
Segment digitizing begins during the JAS and continues until all fields and all segments are completely digitized, this may run thru
July or even until mid-October in some states depending on human resource availability. Segment cleanup analyzes the newly digitized
segments with the new acquired imagery. Fields that are bad either by digitizing or cover type are corrected or removed from training.
Scene processing fits each segment onto a scene by shifting, and cloud-influenced segments are removed. The cluster/classification
process runs in concert with the scene processing steps, as segments are shifted they can be clustered. This process is iterative, and
can run into December. Estimation can be performed once a scene is finished classification, and the user is satisfied with the outputs.
Estimation can begin as early as late October and run into late January/February. The mosaic process runs once estimation is completed.
It is also iterative and can go from late December to March. The mosaic for a particular state is released once the county estimates
are officially released for that state.

"Scene selection begins in early summer, and could run into the late fall depending on image availability. The Cropland Data Layer
program primarily uses the Landsat TM or IRS AWIFS platform for acreage estimation. However, other platforms such as Spot or gap-filled
Landsat ETM+ are used to fill 'data acquisition' holes within a state. A spring and summer date of observation is preferred
for maximum crop cover separation for multi-temporal analysis of summer crops. If only one date of observation is available
(unitemporal), a mid summer date is preferred. If only an early spring date March-May or a fall date September-October is available
(unitemporal) during the growing season, then it is best to not use that scene or analysis district for estimation, as bare soil in
the spring and fully senesced crops in the fall will provide erroneous results.

"The clustering/classification is an iterative process, as fields get misclassified, they can be fixed or marked as bad for training
and reprocessed. Known pixels are separated by cover type and clustered, within cover type using a modified ISODATA clustering
algorithm, as it allows for merging and splitting of clusters. Modified implies that the output clusters are not labeled (other than
as coming from the input cover type) as they can be reassigned later if desired. Clustering is done separately for each cover type (or
specified combination of cover types, such as all small grains). The clustered cover types are then assembled together into one
signature file, where entire scenes are classified using the maximum likelihood algorithm. Clustering is based on the LARSYS (Purdue
University) ISODATA algorithm. It performs an iterative process to divide pixels into groups based on minimum variance. The pairs of
clusters in close proximity (based on Swain-Fu distance) are merged. High variance clusters can be split into two clusters (variance of
first principal component is used as a measure). The output of any clustering program is a statistics file which stores mean vectors
and covariance matrices of final set of clusters.

"The outputs are a categorized or classified image in PEDITOR format and the associated accuracy statistics for each cover type. The
maximum likelihood classifier performs a pixel-by-pixel classification based on the final, combined statistics file. It calculates the
probability of each pixel being from each signature; then classifies a pixel to the category with highest probability. The processing
time depends on size of file to be classified (i.e. number of pixels), number of categories in the statistics file and number of input
dimensions (number of bands/pixel).

"For estimation purposes, clouds can be minimized by defining Analysis Districts (AD) along adjacent scene edges, by cutting the
Analysis Districts by county boundary, or cutting the clouds out by primary sampling units. Analysis Districts can be individual or
multiple scenes footprints that have to be observed on the same date, and analyzed as one. An AD can be comprised of one or more
scenes. An AD can be defined by either a scene edge or a county boundary. Multi-temporal AD's are possible as long as both dates in
all scenes are the same. A single or multi-scene AD will use all potential training fields for clustering/classification/estimation.

"Several factors can lead to problems in a classification, some get corrected in early edits and some do not: poor imagery dates, with
respect to the major crops of interest, complete training fields that are incorrectly identified in the ground truth, parts of training
fields that are not the same as the major crop or cover type, irrigation ditches, wooded areas, low spots filled with water, and/or
bare soil areas in an otherwise vegetated field. Crops that look alike to the clustering algorithm(s) due to planting/growing cycle:
spring wheat and barley at almost any time, crops in senescence, and grassy waste fields and idle cropland. Cover types that are
essentially the same but used differently: wooded pasture versus woods or waste fields (only difference may be the presence of
livestock), corn for grain versus corn silage, and cover crops such as rye and oats. Cover types that change signatures back and forth
during the growing season: alfalfa and other hays before and after cutting, with multiple cuttings per year. Once the analyst is
satisfied with the classification, the next step can be acreage estimation or image mosaicking.

"Three estimation methods are available for each AD: regression, pixel ratio and direct expansion. Where available, regression is
chosen as the preferred type of estimation. This approach essentially corrects the area sample (ground only) estimate based on the
relationship found between reported data and classified pixels in each stratum where it is used. A regression relationship should be
based on 10 or more segments for any stratum used. Where there are not enough segments in each stratum, a pixel based ratio estimator
may be used which essentially combines data across stratum to get the relationship. Finally, the direct expansion (total number of
possible segments times the average for sampled segment) may be used in the absence of pixel based methods. Regression adjusts the
direct expansion estimate based on pixel information. It usually leads to an estimate with a much lower variance than direct expansion
alone. Segments, called outliers, which do not fit the linear relationship estimated by the regression are reviewed; if errors are
found, they are corrected or that segment may be removed from consideration in the analysis.

"Full scene classifications (large scale) are run wherever the regression or pixel ratio estimates are usable. Estimates derived from
the classification are compared to the ground data to make one final check. State estimates are made by summing pixel based estimators
where available and ground data only estimators everywhere else. County estimates are then derived from the state estimates using a
similar approach. Final numbers are delivered to state field offices and the NASS Agricultural Statistics Board for their use in
setting the official final estimates. The states also have administrative data, such as FSA certified acres at the county level, and
other NASS survey data.  Every 5th year, NASS also performs the Census of Agriculture at the county level.

"Each categorized scene is co-registered to MDA Federal Inc's GeoCover LC imagery (50 meters RMS), and then stitched together using
Peditor's Batch program. A block correlation is run between band two from each raw scene, and band two of the ortho-base image. The
registration of the GeoCover mosaicked scene and the individual raw input scenes are used to get an approximate correspondence. A
correlation procedure is used on the raw scenes and the mosaicked scene to get an exact mapping of each pixel from the input scenes to
the mosaicked scene. The results of the correlation are used to remap the pixels from the individual input scenes into the coordinate
system of the mosaicked scene.  The mosaic process now performs: 1) Precision registration of images automatically, 2) Converts each
categorized image and associated statistics file to a set standard automatically (recode), 3) Specify overlap priority by scene or
county, 4) Filters out clouds when possible. The scenes are stitched together using the priorities previously assigned from the scene
observation dates/analysis districts map. Scenes/analysis districts with better quality observation dates are assigned a higher
priority when stitching the images together. Clouds are assigned a null value on all scenes, and scenes of lower priority that are
cloud free, take precedence over clouded higher priority images. Once cloud cover is established throughout the mosaic the clouds are
assigned a digital value.

"The Cropland Data Layer DVD/CD-ROM products contain imagery in GEOTIFF image file format. In order to maximize the visual contrast
between different crops in various states, colors that provide the best contrast for the crop mix in a particular State are chosen.
However, the digital values for each category within every State remain the same. So corn in ND will have the same digital number as
corn in AR. See the stats.htm file in the statinfo directory on the CDL CD-ROM or DVD for a full listing by cover type. The Cropland
Data Layer online image file format is GEOTIFF.

"All CDL distribution for the previous crop year is held until the release of the official NASS county estimates for the major
commodities grown within a given state. Corn and Soybeans are released in March for the previous crop year - Midwestern States. Rice
and Cotton are released in June for the previous crop year - Delta States. Small grains are released in March for the Great Plains
States.

"NASS publishes all available accuracy statistics for end-user viewing. The Percent Correct is calculated for each cover type in the
ground truth, it shows how many of the total pixels were correctly classified (i.e. across all cover types). 'Commission Error' is the
calculated percentage of all pixels categorized to a specific cover type that were not of that cover type in the ground truth (i.e.
incorrectly categorized). CAUTION: a quoted Percent Correct for a specific cover type is worthless unless accompanied by its respective
Commission Error. Example: if you classify every pixel in a scene to 'wheat', then you have a 100 [percent] correct wheat classifier
(however its Commission Error is also almost 100 [percent]). The 'Kappa Statistic' is an attempt to adjust the Percent Correct using
information gained from the confusion matrix for that cover type. Many remote sensing groups use the Percent Correct and/or Kappa
statistics as their final measure of classification accuracy.

"The NASS CDL Program is continuing efforts to reduce end-user burden, increase functionality, and take advantage of enhancements in
computer technology. The Cropland Data Layer Program is a one of a kind agricultural inventory program, where every state participating
in the program is re-surveyed (i.e., ground truthed) every June, and thus re-categorized. The data on the CD-ROM or DVD is in the
public domain, and you are free to do with it as you choose.  NASS would appreciate acknowledgment or credit regarding the source of
the categorized images in any uses that you may have.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_AWIFS_R_IN_2006.tif:

"NASS collects the remote sensing Acreage Estimation Program's field level training data during the June Agricultural Survey. This is
a national survey based on a stratified random sample of land areas selected from each state's area frame. An area frame is a land use
stratification based on percent cultivation. The selected areas are targeted toward cultivated parts of each state based on its area
frame.  Our enumerators are given questionnaires to ask the farmers what, where, when and how much are they planting.  Our surveys focus
on cropland, but the enumerators record all land covers within the sampled area of land whether it is cropland or not.  NASS uses broad
land use categories to define land that is not under cultivation, including; non-agricultural, pasture/rangeland, waste, woods, and
farmstead. NASS defines these non-agricultural land use types very broadly, which makes it difficult to precisely know what specific
type of land use/cover actually is on the ground.  For instance, there is no breakdown as to the type of woods in a given field/pasture,
that's where the power of a GIS could be useful.  If an external forestry GIS layer was overlaid, the land use can be accurately
identified, and the specific cover type can be derived from the data layer. SARS is currently looking at creating extra categories for
the enumerators to better identify non-cropland features, thereby, increasing the accuracy and improving the appearance of the
classification."
