This data set was provided to personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) by Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of
Land Quality personnel on January 29, 2014, and was subsequently updated on April 8, 2015. The data set provided was in an Esri shapefile
format, and was named "2015Landfill_Boundaries.SHP"

LANDFILL_BOUNDARIES_IDEM_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains boundaries for open dump sites, approved landfills, and permitted
landfills in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of
April 8, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri shapefile format and was named "2015Landfill_Boundaries.SHP."
LANDFILL_BOUNDARIES_IDEM_IN.SHP is attributed with facility names, permit numbers, and calculated area. This dataset is not complete, but
comprises the waste boundaries of landfills as a work in progress. IDEM will periodically update and add new boundaries. The closure date
for these landfills runs from the late 1960's to today. Most of them are closed, but a number of them are still active today. Most of
the boundaries were digitized as estimated from IDEM personnel experience, but many were base on georeferencing survey maps that are submitted
by the facility to IDEM. These landfills with more accurate boundaries are indicated by containing an actual value in the attribute field named
"VFC_NO."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This dataset was developed to provide access to landfill boundaries in Indiana that are managed facilities of the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named "2015Landfill_Boundaries.SHP":

"Data was compiled by the Engineering &amp; GIS Section within the Office of Land Quality, the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management. This dataset is incomplete and a work in progress. This dataset contains information that represents what had been
recorded, processed, and archived by IDEM personnel at a time previous to publication. However the dataset may be incomplete and/or
inaccurate due to the ever-changing status of managed facilities and sites, and due to the data collection and processing efforts of
IDEM staff. It is an ever-changing work in progress. The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no formal tests were performed
on accuracy. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values in certain fields are due to the fact that
edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as the project progressed. Human error could have
been a factor as well in data omissions."

IGS personnel received an Esri shapefile named "2014Landfill_Boundaries.SHP" from IDEM personnel on January 29, 2014.
2014Landfill_Boundaries.SHP was loaded into Esri ArcMap 10.2 and the shapefile was visually checked to ensure that all data
provided are contained within the state of Indiana. The attribute fields named "ID" and "ALF_ID" were deleted from the attribute
table. IGS personnel then saved the shapefile as LANDFILL_BOUNDARIES_IDEM_IN.SHP. It should also be noted that portions of the
associated metadata provided by IDEM for 2014Landfill_Boundaries.SHP were extracted and included in this metadata file.
