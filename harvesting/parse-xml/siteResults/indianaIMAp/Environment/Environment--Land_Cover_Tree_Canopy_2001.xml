This grid is one of three grids derived from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001). The three associated
grids provide data regarding land cover (LC2001USGS_IN), estimated percentages of tree canopy (TC2001USGS_IN), and
estimated percentages of imperviousness (IS2001USGS_IN). These grids and their associated metadata were downloaded
from the following Web site of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium:

TC2001USGS_IN is a grid (30-meter cell size) showing the estimated percentages of tree canopy in Indiana in 2001. This
grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2001) data set. Tree canopy estimates are shown in this data set
as percentages when the associated layer file (TC2001USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded.

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2001
(http://extract.cr.usgs.gov/distmeta/servlet/gov.usgs.edc.MetaBuilder?TYPE=HTML&amp;DATASET=NLCD01CANO&amp;YMAX=39.611501479289956&amp;YMIN=39.611501479289956&amp;XMIN=-76.63165680473374&amp;XMAX=-76.63165680473374):

"The National Land Cover Database 2001 tree canopy layer for mapping zone 60 was produced through a cooperative project
conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal
agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS), the
National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent,
seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution.
For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and
&lt;http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp&gt;.

"The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within
the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edgematching features and the size requirement
of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states in the mid-Atlantic region, including
the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Questions about the
NLCD mapping zone 60 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC), Sioux
Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov."

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2001:

"Regression tree algorithms employed in NLCD 2001 mapping offer a cross-validation option for assessing classification
and prediction reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for tree canopy predictions if
the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistical valid sampling design. For mapping
zone 60 tree canopy modeling, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into
5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model
prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After
all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates and standard error's from the 5 run's were computed. Users
should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality,
and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment."

"This NLCD product of mapping zone 60 Tree Canopy layer is the version 1 dated 09-01-2003.

"The NLCD 2001 database for mapping zone 60 consists of three main data products including: (1) per pixel classified
land-cover data (2) sub-pixel percent imperviousness and (3) sub-pixel percent tree canopy density. The land-cover
database also includes three additional metadata layers that provide users a spatial node map of the land cover
classification, a spatial confidence map of the land cover classification, and a text file of logical statements
pertinent to the land cover classification. The three layers are: (1) a spatial node map of the land cover
classification, (2) a spatial confidence map of the land cover classification, and, (3) a text file of logical
statements related to the land cover classification. These additional metadata layers may be of interest to some
data users with specific needs. If you are interested in the detailed metadata information, please refer to

The following information was excerpted from information provided by the USGS and the
Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium:

"The method employed to map tree canopy density for NLCD 2001 consists of three key steps: deriving reference
data of tree canopy density from the high spatial resolution images, calibrating density prediction models using
reference data and Landsat spectral bands, and extrapolating the developed models spatially to map per-pixel tree
canopy density. This method is described in detail in Huang et al. (2001). This approach was applied to mapping
zone 60 by Earth Satellite Corporation (through Greenhorne &amp; O'Mara Inc.) under USGS contract.

"To develop adequate training data for tree canopy density estimation, 21 1-m resolution DOQQ's across mapping zone
60 were classified into either tree canopy or non-tree canopy areas, and then values summed within each 30 meter
Landsat pixel cell to obtain the percentage of tree canopy. The training data was selected with a Sample Selection
Tool developed by Earthsat Inc. based on the degree of variance each training data set possesses with regards to
Landsat ETM+ imagery used for mapping. Each added training data set decreased the amount of variance present within
the Landsat data as a whole. The process was repeated until the required number of samples (21) had been allocated."

Personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey used the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium's
interactive viewer and download tool (found at http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k_nlcd.asp) to download two raster
tiff images showing the estimated percentages of tree canopy for the Indiana portion of the National Landcover
Database (NLCD 2001).

The "Data Preparation &gt; Mosiac Images" command from the ImageAnalysis extension (version 9.2, build 8.9.1.204) in
ESRI ArcGIS 9.2 was used to mosaic the two images into one tiff image for Indiana. The "Data Preparation &gt; Subset Images"
command was then used to clip the image to the Indiana boundary. The output image was then saved as an ESRI Grid
named "TC2001USGS_IN". TC2001USGS_IN was then projected to Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 16, NAD 1983.
