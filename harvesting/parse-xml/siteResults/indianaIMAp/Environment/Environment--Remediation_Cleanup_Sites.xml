CLEANUP_SITES_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains locations of cleanup sites in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental
Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of June 4, 2009 and subsequently updated on October 20, 2009, April 16, 2010, June 23, 2013, and February 25, 2015.
The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named "STATE_CLEANUP."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile STATE_CLEANUP:

"State Cleanup sites that are on the Commissioner’s Bulletin or referred remedial response locations or other IDEM programs that require mitigation of risk
to human health and the environment through investigation, remediation or institutional controls."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This data set was developed to provide accurate coordinate information for managed facilities and customers of the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
This data set contains mainly the locations of access points to managed sites, along with a unique identifier for each location. In a few instances other features
were used as a reference for the location of the managed sites. Also included are method, accuracy and description codes (metadata) for each entry.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile STATE_CLEANUP:

"All attributes created during the process were verified by displaying the records in the database and verifying
consistency. However, no formal tests of accuracy were performed. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or
verified. Omissions or null values in certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding
or deleting attribute information) as the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field
with the ommission was not relative to the method used to collect the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile STATE_CLEANUP:

"This data set consists of locations of cleanup sites that are on the Commissioner’s Bulletin or referred remedial response locations
within the state of Indiana. This dataset is incomplete and a work in progress, as sites are GPS'd as they are
inspected. This dataset contains information that represents what had been recorded, processed, and archived by IDEM personnel
at a time previous to publication. However the data set may be incomplete and/or inaccurate due to the ever-changing status of
managed facilities and sites, and due to the data collection and processing efforts of IDEM staff. It is an ever-changing work
in progress. Data were collected by the Solid Waste Compliance section  within the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of
Environmental Management. The Section was also responsible for collecting attribute information for each location. The data has
been QA/QC'd for consistency but no formal tests were performed on accuracy.  Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified.
Omissions or null values in certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting
attribute information) as the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field with the ommission
was not relative to the method used to collect the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile STATE_CLEANUP:

"The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system. The accuracy of the coordinates for GPS data should be from 1-5 meters,
depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment (ie., multipath, SNR, and PDOP), and the number of
positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Each GPS unit should have been
configured within the specifications of the manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field personnel would configure the unit
outside of specifications if environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by logging both Maximum PDOP and the
standard deviations of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value was &gt; 6, the value for the
"In_specs" field was input as "NO". If the standard deviation was &gt; 8, the corrected GPS file was analyzed for signs of multipath
and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the archive. If the data set was uneditable it was still
left in the archive, the "In-specs" field was changed to "No" and the location could have an accuracy &gt; 5 meters.

If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection as defined by the
technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then the accuracy of the collected
coordinates should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to
5 meters (post-processed) and the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters (post-processed).

If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those given by the
manufacturer."

      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile STATE_CLEANUP:

"The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less
accurate than horizontal accuracy. The vertical accuracy for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error.  However,
this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values have been recorded, but it is strongly
suggested that the values not be used for any analysis.

Due to the nature of how these values are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large enough
to make the coordinate values unuseable in any type of locational analysis."

IGS personnel received an updated Esri geodatabase (and metadata) named "IndianaMapUpdate_June2013.gdb" from IDEM personnel
(Shane Moore) on June 25, 2013. "IndianaMapUpdate_June2013.gdb" was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 10.1 and the subset of data containing cleanup
sites were examine and exported to an ESRI shapfile format. The following attribute fields were deleted from the associated attribute
table: AGENCY_INT, SUB_PROGRA, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, METHOD_DES, COLLECTOR_, COLLECTOR1, ACCURACY, ACCURACY_U, GPS_RECEIV, SOURCE_MAP,
EASTING, and NORTHING.
