WASTE_DISPOSAL_STORAGE_HANDLING_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains waste site locations for the disposal, storage, and
handling of solid and hazardous waste in Indiana. It was provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management,
Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of June 25, 2013 and subsequently updated on February 25, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM
was in an Esri geodatabase format, and the feature class was named WasteD_S_H_SWHW. WASTE_DISPOSAL_STORAGE_HANDLING_IDEM_IN is attributed
with facility identifications, federal identification numbers, IDEM managing program and sub-program codes, and site names. Facility
information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Solid Waste Compliance Section, Office of Land Quality,
Indiana Department of Environmental Management.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named WasteD_S_H_SWHW:

"This project is the first phase in the creation of a base locational data set to establish Geographic Information Systems
as an integral part of Solid Waste facilities for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. Inspectors and
Environmental Project Managers were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems.  Solid Waste
Complicance Inspectors then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites as part of the daily
inspection/management of Solid Waste sites.  This information was then brought back to the office, processed, and
QA/AC'd before being deposited in a central archive.  The data set also includes address-matched and map-interpolated
locations.  These are being upgraded to GPS locations as time allows."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This data set was developed to provide accurate coordinate information for managed facilities and customers of the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
This data set generally contains the location of access points to managed sites, along with a unique identifier for each
location. Types of waste sites include construction/demolition waste, composting of CFO waste, clean fill, municipal, non-municipal,
open dumps, restricted waste, surface impoundments, sanitary landfills, incinerators, material recovery, medical wates, recycling,
and waste transfer stations.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named WasteD_S_H_SWHW:

"All attributes created during the process were verified by displaying the records in the database and verifying consistency
with the regional Permit Managers. However, no formal tests of accuracy were performed. Therefore accuracy cannot be
guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values in certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data
dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly
left out, or the field with the ommission was not relative to the method used to collect the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named WasteD_S_H_SWHW:

"This data set consists of locations of active permitted solid waste sites within the state of Indiana. This data set contains
information that represented what had been recorded, processed, and archived by IDEM personnel at a time previous to
publication. However the data set may be incomplete and/or inaccurate due to the ever-changing status of permitted
facilities, and due to the data collection and processing efforts of IDEM staff. It is an ever-changing work in progress.
Data were collected by the Solid Waste Compliance section within the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of
Environmental Management. The Section was also responsible for collecting attribute information for each location.
The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no formal tests were performed on accuracy. Therefore accuracy cannot
be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values in certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the
data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly
left out, or the field with the ommission was not relative to the method used to collect the data. Map interpolated and
address-matched locations were compiled by the Applied Science Technologies Section. The map-interpolated and address-matched
locational data are suspect. Please refer to the Process Step tab under Data Quality for more information on how these
coordinates were collected."

This data set was provided by IDEM personnel and is assumed to be accurate.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named WasteD_S_H_SWHW:

"The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system, address-matched, or derived through map interpolation. The accuracy of the
coordinates for GPS data should be from 1-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment
(ie., multipath, SNR, and PDOP), and the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy cannot be guaranteed
or verified.  Each GPS unit should have been configured within the specifications of the manufacturer. However, if necessary, the
field personnel would configure the unit outside of specifications if environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by
logging both Maximum PDOP and the standard deviations of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value
was 6, the value for the "In_specs" field was input as "NO." If the standard deviation was 8, the corrected GPS file was analyzed
for signs of multipath and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the archive. If the data set was
uneditable it was still left in the archive, the "In-specs" field was changed to "No" and the location could have an accuracy of
5 meters. Addressed matched data and map interpolation had no formal tests for accuracy so accuracy for these locations is
"unknown." However, the Agency is in the process of upgrading the locational information for these sites with GPS data. Contact
the Applied Science Technologies section with questions or for updates.

If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection as defined by the
technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then the accuracy of the collected coordinates
should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExploer 2 Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5 meters
(post-processed), and the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters (post-processed).

If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those given by the
manufacturer."
</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>
The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less accurate than horizontal accuracy. The vertical accuracy
for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error. However, this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid
values have been recorded, but it is strongly suggested that the values not be used for any analysis. Due to the nature of how these values
are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large enough to make the coordinate values unusable in any type of
locational analysis.
