The source data set was obtained as a georeferenced TIFF image named "CDL_2016_clip.tif." The original data set and its metadata are available through
the official NASS USDA Web site referred to as "CropScape" &lt;http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/&gt;.

NOTE -- The georeferenced TIFF image named "CDL_2016_clip.tif" that was created by the USDA is identical to the georeferenced TIFF image named
"CROPS_2016_USDA_IN.TIF" that is distributed by the Indiana Geological and Water Survey (IGWS). Only the filename and metadata have been modified
to conform to IGWS conventions.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_2016_CLIP.tif:

"The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer. The 2016 CDL has a ground resolution of 30
meters. The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) DEIMOS-1 and UK2
sensors collected during the current growing season.

"Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the classification. These additional sources can include
the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED) and the imperviousness and canopy data layers from the USGS National Land Cover
Database 2011 (NLCD 2011).

"Agricultural training and validation data are derived from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) Program. The most current version of the NLCD
is used as non-agricultural training and validation data. Please refer to the 'Supplemental_Information' Section of this metadata file for a complete list of
all imagery, ancillary data, and training/validation data used to generate this state's CDL.

"The strength and emphasis of the CDL is agricultural land cover. Please note that no farmer reported data are derivable from the Cropland Data Layer."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_2016_CLIP.tif:

"The purpose of the Cropland Data Layer Program is to use satellite imagery to (1) provide acreage estimates to the Agricultural Statistics Board for the state's
major commodities and (2) produce digital, crop-specific, categorized geo-referenced output products."
</purpose>

"NOTE: The final extent of the CDL is clipped to the state boundary even though the raw input data may encompass a larger area."

"These definitions of accuracy statistics were derived from the following book: Congalton, Russell G. and Kass Green. Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely
Sensed Data: Principles and Practices. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, Inc. 1999. The 'Producer's Accuracy' is calculated for each cover type in the ground
truth and indicates the probability that a ground truth pixel will be correctly mapped (across all cover types) and measures 'errors of omission'. An
'Omission Error' occurs when a pixel is excluded from the category to which it belongs in the validation dataset. The 'User's Accuracy' indicates the probability
that a pixel from the CDL classification actually matches the ground truth data and measures 'errors of commission'. The 'Commission Error' represent when a pixel
is included in an incorrect category according to the validation data. It is important to take into consideration errors of omission and commission. For example,
if you classify every pixel in a scene to 'wheat', then you have 100% Producer's Accuracy for the wheat category and 0% Omission Error. However, you would also
have a very high error of commission as all other crop types would be included in the incorrect category. The 'Kappa' is a measure of agreement based on the
difference between the actual agreement in the error matrix (i.e., the agreement between the remotely sensed classification and the reference data as indicated
by the major diagonal) and the chance agreement which is indicated by the row and column totals. The 'Conditional Kappa Coefficient' is the agreement for an
individual category within the entire error matrix."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by NASS (USDA) for the source data set CDL_2016_CLIP.tif:

"OVERVIEW: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) Program
is a unique agricultural-specific land cover geospatial product that is produced annually in participating states. The CDL Program builds upon NASS'
traditional crop acreage estimation program and integrates Farm Service Agency (FSA) grower-reported field data with satellite imagery to create an
unbiased statistical estimator of crop area at the state and county level for internal use. It is important to note that the internal acreage estimates
produced using the CDL are not simple pixel counting. It is more of an 'Adjusted Census by Satellite.'

"SOFTWARE: ERDAS Imagine is used in the pre- and post- processing of all raster-based data. ESRI ArcGIS is used to prepare the vector-based training
and validation data. Rulequest See5.0 is used to create a decision tree based classifier. The NLCD Mapping Tool is used to apply the See5.0 decision-tree
via ERDAS Imagine.

"DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER: This Cropland Data Layer used the decision tree classifier approach. Using a decision tree classifier is a departure from
older versions of the CDL which were created using in-house software (Peditor) based upon a maximum likelihood classifier approach. Check the 'Process Description'
section of the specific state and year metadata file to verify the methodology used. Decision trees offer several advantages over the more traditional
maximum likelihood classification method. The advantages include being: 1) non-parametric by nature and thus not reliant on the assumption of the input data
being normally distributed, 2) efficient to construct and thus capable of handling large and complex data sets, 3) able to incorporate missing and
non-continuous data, and 4) able to sort out non-linear relationships.

"GROUND TRUTH: As with the maximum likelihood method, decision tree analysis is a supervised classification technique. Thus, it relies on having a sample
of known ground truth areas in which to train the classifier. Older versions of the CDL (prior to 2006) utilized ground truth data from the annual June
Agricultural Survey (JAS). Beginning in 2006, the CDL utilizes the very comprehensive ground truth data provided from the FSA Common Land Unit (CLU) Program
as a replacement for the JAS data. The FSA CLU data have the advantage of natively being in a GIS and containing magnitudes more of field level information.
Disadvantages include that it is not truly a probability sample of land cover and has bias toward subsidized program crops. Additional information about
the FSA data can be found at &lt;http://www.fsa.usda.gov/&gt;. The most current version of the NLCD is used as non-agricultural training and validation data.

"INPUTS: The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) DEIMOS-1 and UK2
sensors collected during the current growing season. The DEIMOS-1 and UK-DMC 2 imagery was resampled to 30 meters using cubic convolution, rigorous transformation
to match the traditional Landsat spatial resolution. Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and ancillary inputs to supplement and improve
the classification. These additional sources can include the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED) and the imperviousness
and canopy data layers from the USGS National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD 2011). Please refer to the 'Supplemental_Information' Section of this metadata
file for a complete list of all imagery and ancillary data used to generate this state's CDL.

"ACCURACY: The accuracy of the land cover classifications are evaluated using independent validations data sets generated from the FSA CLU data
(agricultural categories) and the NLCD 2011 (non-agricultural categories). The Producer's Accuracy is generally 85% to 95% correct for the major crop-specific
land cover categories. See the 'Attribute Accuracy Report' section of this metadata file for the full accuracy report.

IGWS personnel acquired crop data for 2016 from the offical USDA NASS Cropscape web site (http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) in the form of
a georeferenced TIFF image. It was reprojected from "WGS_1984_UTM_Zone16N" to "NAD_1983_UTM_Zone16N" using ESRI ArcCatalog. In order to conform
to naming and metadata conventions of the Indiana Geological and Water Survey, the image was re-named and the metadata was modified accordingly.
