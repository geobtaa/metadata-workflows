Prime farmland and Hydric soil percentages were calculated by summarizing
the component table associated with each soil map unit featured.  Shapefile
features are soil map units, and can only give a percentage of prime farmland
or hydric soils occuring within them.  The actual boundary of specific prime
farmland or hydric soils is NOT shown in the features.

"This data set is a digital general soil association map developed by the
National Cooperative Soil Survey. It consists of a broad based inventory
of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the
landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped.
The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed
soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available,
data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are assembled,
together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like
areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the
soils are determined."

Prime farmland and hydric soil percentage attributes were created by
performing a summary on the components table for all components that
make up each map unit.

Natural Resources Conservation Service, STATSGO metadata reports-

"The accuracy of attributes is tested by manual comparison of the source with
hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an
interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be
visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and
verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a
master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute
codes in the signed classification and correlation document and
amendments and are current as of the date of digitizing."

"Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are
collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements. (The GT-polygon
corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these requirements include-
chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at
nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are
defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains
representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps. The tests
of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. The neatline is
generated by connecting the explicitly entered four corners of the digital
file. All data outside the enclosed region are ignored and all data crossing
these geographically straight lines are clipped at the neatline. Data within
a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Neatline
straightening aligns the digitized edges of the digital data with the
generated neatline (i.e., with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic
coordinates). All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor
software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common
soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Quadrangles are
edge matched within the state, merged into a statewide data sets, and then
edge matched to adjacent state data sets. Edge locations do not deviate from
centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inches."

"A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same in terms
of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs in some respect
from all others in a survey area and is uniquely identified. Each individual
area is a delineation. Each map unit consists of one to 21 components.

In those few areas where detailed maps did not exist, reconnaissance soil
surveys were combined with data on geology, topography, vegetation, climate,
and remote sensing images to delineate map units and estimate the
percentages of components. The STATSGO map unit components are soil series
phases, and their percent composition represents the estimated areal
proportion of each within STATSGO map unit. The composition for a map unit
is generalized to represent the statewide extent of that map unit and not
the extent of any single map unit delineation. These specifications provide
a nationally consistent representation of STATSGO attribute data.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on statistical analysis of transect data. The
composition was largely determined by measuring transects on detailed soil
survey maps. The number of transects used was proportional to the relative
size, number, and complexity of the delineations. The combined data on the
length of the map units crossed by the transects were used to determine the
percentages of the different soil and nonsoil areas in each map unit.

Specific limits were established on the classification of soils and the
design and name of map units. These limits are outlined in U.S. Department
of Agriculture. 1975. Soil Taxonomy: A basic system of soil classification
for making and interpreting soil surveys. Soil Conserv. Serv., U.S. Dep.
Agric. Handb. 436.; U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1992. Keys to Soil
Taxonomy. SMSS Technical Monograph No. 19. Soil Surv. Staff, Soil Conserv.
Serv.; U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1993. National Soil Survey Handbook, title
430-VI. Soil Surv. Staff, Soil Conserv. Serv.; and U.S. Department of
Agriculture. 1993. Soil Survey Manual. Soil Surv. Staff, U.S. Dep. Agric.

Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is
based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in documents that reside with the Natural Resources
Conservation Service state soil scientist."

Natural Resources Conservation Service, STATSGO metadata reports-

"The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation
to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards. The difference
in positional accuracy between the map unit boundaries in the field and
their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational acuracy of soil
delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units.
For example, in areas where changes in soils, climate, topography, and
geology occur subtly across a portion of a state, the transition between
soil map unit boundaries will be gradual. Where these features change
abruptly, such as from an area of foothills to a lake plain, the
transition will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries were
digitized within 0.01 inches of their locations on the digitizing
source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The
data along each state boundary are matched against the data for the
adjacent state. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline
to centerline by more than 0.01 inch."

mylar overlay that was punch registered to fit the mylar USGS
1:250,000-scale topographic quadrangle. A detailed and complete edit was
performed on all overlays before digitizing. The soil delineation
overlays were raster scanned at a scanning resolution of at least 0.01
inches and converted to a vector format or were manually digitized on a
digitizing tablet with a resolution of at least 0.001 inches. Four
control points corresponding to the four corners of the quadrangles were
used for registration during data collection. The control points were
either explicitly entered or developed by the software. The data sets
were edge matched and merged into statewide coverages. A detailed and
complete edit was performed on all digital data.

The accessory "comp.dbf" table which accompanies the original STATSGO file for the state
lists the components of each soil association, the % of the association made up of that
component, and if it is designated as hydric, prime farmland, or conditional prime
farmland.  One association may be made of 1-20 components.  The components within a soil
association which had hydric or farmland properties were identified and then the % of
those components within a particular association were added.  These % were joined to
the main table along with the name of the association from the "mapunit.dbf" table.

This metadata was pre-parsed and parsed using CNS (Chew and Spit. v 2.6.1) and
MP (Metadata Parser, v 2.7.1) software written by Peter N. Schweitzer (United

addressed and corrected, except that no values were assigned to
"Abscissa_Resolution" and "Ordinate_Resolution."
