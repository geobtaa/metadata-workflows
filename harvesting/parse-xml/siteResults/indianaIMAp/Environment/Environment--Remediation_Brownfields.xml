BROWNFIELDS_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains brownfield locations in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of
Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of January 4, 2005 and subsequently updated on April 25, 2005, July 27,
2006, January 24, 2007, June 4, 2009, April 16, 2010, June 25, 2013, and February 25, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an
Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named "BROWNFIELDS."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile BROWNFIELDS:

"Indiana defines a brownfield site as a parcel of real estate that is abandoned or inactive; or may not be operated at its
appropriate use; and on which expansion, redevelopment, or reuse is complicated; because of the presence or potential
presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum, or a petroleum product that poses a risk to human health
and the environment.

As our undeveloped land continues to disappear, we recognize the need to redevelop and reuse land that may have viable
buildings and infrastructure already present.  The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation
resources can lower the costs to a potential developer.  Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by
rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight.  Because the potential environmental liability
at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup
costs.  Thus, the properties remain idle.  In response to these issues the IDEM, in conjunction with the Indiana
Development Finance Authority,and the Indiana Department of Commerce offers financial assistance in the form of
grants and low-interest loans for site assessment, remediation, and demolition.  The IDEM provides assistance by
performing technical oversight and review."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile BROWNFIELDS:

"All attributes created during the process were verified by displaying the lines in the database and verifying consistency.
However, no formal tests were performed.  Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Omissions or null values in
certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as
the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field with the ommission was not relative to
the method used to collect the data."

"Data were collected by the Brownfields Section within the Office of Land Quality, the Indiana Department
of Environmental Management.  This dataset is incomplete and a work in progress, as sites are GPS'd as they are inspected.
This dataset contains information that represents what had been recorded, processed, and archived by IDEM personnel
at a time previous to publication.  However the data set may be incomplete and/or inaccurate due to the ever-changing
status of managed facilities and sites, and due to the data collection  and processing efforts of IDEM staff.  It
is an ever-changing work in progress. The Brownfields Section was also responsible for collecting attribute
information for each location.  The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no formal test were performed on accuracy.
Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values in certain fields is due to the fact that
edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as the project progressed.
Human error could have been a factor as well in data omissions."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile BROWNFIELDS:

"The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system. The accuracy of the
coordinates should be from 1-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment
(ie., multipath, SNR, and PDOP), and the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy
cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Each GPS unit should have been configured within the specifications of the
manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field personnel would configure the unit outside of specifications if
environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by logging both Maximum PDOP and the standard deviations
of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value was &gt; 6, the value for the "In_specs"
field was input as "NO". If the standard deviation was &gt; 8, the corrected GPS file was analyzed for signs of
multipath and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the archive. If the data set was
uneditable it was still left in the archive.  The "In-specs" field was changed to "No" and the location could
have an accuracy &gt; 5 meters.

If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection as defined by the
technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then the accuracy of the collected coordinates
should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5 meters (post-processed),
the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters (post-processed), and the Pro XR has a range of .50 cm - 1m differential accuracy to
real-time differential correction.

If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those given by the
manufacturer."
</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile BROWNFIELDS:

"The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less
accurate than horizontal accuracy. The vertical accuracy for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error.  However,
this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values have been recorded, but it is strongly
suggested that the values not be used for any analysis.

Due to the nature of how these values are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large enough
to make the coordinate values unuseable in any type of locational analysis."

IGS personnel received an updated Esri geodatabase (and metadata) named "GPSDATA_UPDATES.MDB" from IDEM personnel
(Shane Moore) on January 24, 2007. GPSDATA_UPDATES.MDB was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.2 and the
subset of data containing brownfield locations were examined.
No changes in this dataset were apparent from the last update date on July 27, 2006 so only the metadata was
edited to reflect this information. No changes to the BROWNFIELDS_IDEM_IN.SHP were made.
