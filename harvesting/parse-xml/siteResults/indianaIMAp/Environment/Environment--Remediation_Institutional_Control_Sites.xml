INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IDEM_IN is a polygon shapefile that contains Institutional Control (IC) site locations in Indiana, provided by
personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of March 17, 2009 and subsequently
updated on June 4, 2009, August 12, 2009, October 20, 2009, November 18, 2009, December 16, 2009, April 16, 2010, December 12, 2011,
February 20, 2012, April 10, 2012, January 9, 2013, April 5, 2013, June 5, 2013, August 7, 2013, December 5, 2013, May 13, 2014,
September 16, 2014, and February 25, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an ESRI shapefile format and was named
"OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP." INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IDEM_IN.SHP is attributed with facility names, identification numbers,
restriction descriptions, and a list of chemical contaminants.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named "OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP":

"Institutional Control (IC) polygons were created by Coordinate Geometry (COGO) from recorded Environmental
Restrictive Covenants (ERCs) and other Institutional Controls (ICs) mandated by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management."

      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named "OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP":

"This dataset was developed to provide the spatial component of recorded Institutional Controls for managed facilities of the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management. When any amount of contamination above a residential closure level is left on site, a legal
measure called an Institutional Control (IC) may be needed. An IC protects human health and the environment by restricting property
activity, use, or access. As an example, the RISC guidance may allow a site to be remediated only to levels appropriate for industrial
or commercial uses. In this case, an IC would be required that would restrict the use of the property to non-residential purposes in
the future."
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named "OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP":

"A corrective action plan was prepared and implemented in accordance with statute(s) IC 13-23, IC 13-24, and/or IC 13-25] and/or other
applicable Indiana law as a result of a release of petroleum or regulated substances (collectively, "contaminants of concern") which
affected the Real Estate. Certain response activities have been implemented at the Real Estate,  e.g., soil removal to remediate specific
contaminants in specific areas of the site; placement of engineered cap; remediation of groundwater, etc.

"The corrective action plan, as approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, provides that contaminants of concern
will remain in the groundwater and/or in the soil of the Real Estate and requires that land use restrictions that must be maintained
to ensure the protection of public health, safety, or welfare, and the environment."

However the dataset may be incomplete and/or inaccurate due to the ever-changing status of managed facilities and sites, and due
to the data collection and processing efforts of IDEM staff. It is an ever-changing work in progress. The Engineering &amp; GIS section
was also responsible for collecting attribute information for each location. The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no formal
tests were performed on accuracy. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values in certain fields
are due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as the project progressed.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named "OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP":

"The referenced point data was collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system. The accuracy of the coordinates for GPS data should be
from .5-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment (ie., multipath, SNR, and PDOP), and
the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Each GPS unit should
have been configured within the specifications of the manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field personnel would configure
the unit outside of specifications if environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by logging both Maximum PDOP and
the standard deviations of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value was &gt; 6, the value for the
"In_specs" field was input as "NO". If the standard deviation was &gt; 8, the corrected GPS file was analyzed for signs of multipath
and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the archive. If the data set was uneditable it was still left
in the archive, the "In-specs" field was changed to "No" and the location  could have an accuracy &gt; 5 meters.

"The following explanation corresponds to the small traingular polygons used as ERC place markers:

"If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection as defined by the
technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then the accuracy of the collected coordinates
should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5 meters (post-processed),
the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters (post-processed), and the Pro XR has a range of .50 cm - 1m differential accuracy to
real-time differential correction.

"If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those given by the
manufacturer.

"The following explanation corresponds to the polygons that are COGO'ed in using the recorded ERC Exhibit A:

"The recorded ERC Exhibit A (Legal Description of Real Estate) was based on original recorded surveys. The original descriptions
may have been modified outside of IDEM's control, therefore the accuracy is unknown. The quality control step that IDEM personnel
used is that the digital polygon closed (no accuracy is guaranteed or implied)."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named "OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP":

"The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less accurate than horizontal accuracy. The vertical accuracy
for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error. However, this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values
have been recorded, but it is strongly suggested that the values not be used for any analysis.

"Due to the nature of how these values are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large enough
to make the coordinate values unuseable in any type of locational analysis.

"Small triangular polygons representing points were created representing the portion of this dataset that have not been COGO'ed yet,
or did not have sufficient data to be COGO'ed. These triangular polygons were digitized using heads-up digitizing over the facilities
point layer at a scale of 1:2,000 when the point was displayed at a size of four (circle2 symbol). COGO'ed descriptions from recorded

Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) personnel have used recorded Environmental Restrictive Covenants (ERCs) to create
polygons that delineate real property where contamination above a residential closure level is left on site. The polygons are derived
from Exhibit A (Legal Description of Real Estate) from a recorded ERC of a regulated facility. The polygons are created using Coordinate
Geometry (COGO) in ESRI ArcInfo software.

This data set is ongoing and ERCs that have not been COGO'ed, or do not have sufficient data to complete the COGO process, are represented
by small triangular polygons.

The ERC polygon attributes are correlated and attached with the fields from the IDEM Institutional Controls Registry database.

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named "OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP" from IDEM personnel on March 17, 2009.
OLQ_INSTITUTIONAL_CONTROLS_IN.SHP was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.3 and the shapefile was visually checked to ensure that all data
