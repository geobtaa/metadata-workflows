This data set was provided to personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) by Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of
Land Quality personnel on November 13, 2015. The data set provided was in an Esri personal geodatabase format, and was named
"Coal_Combustion_Waste_20151113.MDB" that contained a polygon feature class named "INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS."

COAL_COMBUSTION_WASTE_IMPOUNDMENTS_INSPECTED_IDEM_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains coal combustion waste impoundmentes (CCW) in Indiana
that have been inspected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management,
Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of November 13, 2015. The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri personal database format and was named
"Coal_Combustion_Waste_20151113.MDB" that contained a polygon feature class named "INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS."
COAL_COMBUSTION_WASTE_IMPOUNDMENTS_INSPECTED_IDEM_IN.SHP is attributed with observations by IDEM staff and information found in US EPA contracted
reports about the structural integrety and hazard potential some of the impoundment dams.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source feature class INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS:

"CCW impoundments were digitized by IDEM staff from aerial photo-interpretation. This was done in response to the CCW impoundment
failure at the TVA/Kingston coal burning electric generating facility during December of 2008, and IDEM's recognition of the need
to know the precise locations of these waste features, and what impacts similar failures may have on the Indiana landscape. Also
in response to this failure, US EPA initiated a nationwide program assessing the structural integrety and safety of CCW impoundments.
US EPA contracted for inspections of these facilities, and information from the reports of Indiana facilities are included in the IDEM
developed attributes of these features. The attributes, information about the features in tabular format, were compiled from information
taken from the published reports of impoundment inspections done by US EPA contracted firms, and notes from IDEM field inspections, as
well as observations made by IDEM GIS staff as the features were digitally mapped. The qualitative and quatitative attributes provide
information of impoundment size, capacity, dike/dam hazard potential, types of waste placed in the impoundment, owner, facility name,
impoundment use, and field observations by IDEM inspectors and USEPA contrated specialists.

"The USEPA contracted nation wide reports are found: http://www3.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/industrial/special/fossil/surveys2/index.htm#_ga=1.5580723.182041078.1443707387

"From the EPA reports: 'A CCW management unit is defined as a surface impoundment or similar diked or bermed management unit or management
units designated as landfills that receive liquidborne material and are used for the storage or disposal of residuals or by-products from
the combustion of coal, including, but not limited to, fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, or flu gas emission control residuals. Management
units also include inactive impoundments that have not been formally closed in compliance with applicable federal or state
closure/reclamation regulations.'"
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source feature class INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS:

"These data were developed to provide the spatial context for Coal Combustion Waste (CCW) (also referred to as Coal Combustion
Residuals (CCR)) impoundments located in Indiana. CCW impoundments are areas used for emplacement of liquid borne waste material
resulting from the burning of coal for the production of electricity. The map feature's attributes include observations by IDEM
staff and information found in US EPA contracted reports about the structural integrety and hazard potential some of the impoundment
dams. This data set was developed by digitizing areas interpreted to be CCW impoundments from aerial photo interpretation,
therefore some of these feature have not been verified by direct field observation. CCW/CCR impoundments that have been field
verified are also included in these data, as is information from those inspected impoundments reports."

IGS personnel received an Esri personal geodatabase named "Coal_Combustion_Waste_20151113.MDB" from IDEM personnel on January 29, 2014, which
contained the polygon feature class named "INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS". INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS was loaded into Esri ArcMap 10.3 and the
shapefile was visually checked to ensure that all data provided are contained within the state of Indiana. IGS personnel then exported the
layer as an Esri shapefile named COAL_COMBUSTION_WASTE_IMPOUNDMENTS_INSPECTED_IDEM_IN.SHP. The attribute fields named "State_ID "
and "Permit_Number" were deleted from the atttribute table because they contained no data. It should also be noted that portions of the
associated metadata provided by IDEM for the source feature class named "INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS" were extracted and included in this
metadata file.

"Yes" / "No" values if the impoundments were included in the USEPA report. Many facilities

of the USEPA inspection.

        <attrlabl>Hazard_Pot</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>
The hazard potential for dam failure. From Federal Guidlines for Dam Safety, the Hazard Potential Classification
System for Dams is based on the probable loss of human life and the potential for economic losses, environmental damage, and/or
disruption to lifelines caused by failure of mis-operation of a dam or its appurtenances. LESS THAN LOW HAZARD POTENTIAL: Failure or
misoperation of the dam results in no probable loss of human life or economic or environmental losses. LOW HAZARD POTENTIAL: Dams
where failure or misoperation results in no probable loss of human life or economic or environmental losses. Losses are principally
limited to the owner's property. SIGNIFICANT HAZARD POTENTIAL: Dams where failure or misoperation results in no probable loss of
human life but can cause economic loss, environmental damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or can impact other concerns.
Dams are often located in predominatley rural or agricultural areas, but couild be located in areas with population
and significant infrastructure. HIGH HAZARD POTENTIAL: Dams where failure or misoperation will probably cause loss of human life.
