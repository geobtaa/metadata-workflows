OPEN_DUMPS_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains open dump site locations in Indiana, provided by personnel of
Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of July 11, 2003 and was subsequently
updated on June 3, 2004, January 4, 2005, April 25, 2005, July 27, 2006, January 24, 2007, June 4, 2009, October 20, 2009, and
April 16, 2010. The data set provided by IDEM was in an ESRI geodatabase format and the feature class was named "OPEN_DUMP."
OPEN_DUMPS_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility names and federal identification numbers.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile OPEN_DUMP:

"This dataset consists of Open Dumps - Sites that are not regulated and are illegal dump sites of solid
waste, as defined by IAC 10-2-28 329 and IAC 10-2-128 of the Indiana Administrative Code."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This data set was developed to provide accurate coordinate information for managed facilities and customers of the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
This data set generally contains the location of access points to managed sites, along with a unique identifier for each
location.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile OPEN_DUMP:

"All attributes created during the process were verified by displaying the lines in the database and verifying consistency.
However, no formal tests were performed.  Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Omissions or null values in
certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as
the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field with the ommission was not relative to
the method used to collect the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile OPEN_DUMP:

"This data set consists of locations of Open Dump Sites within the state of Indiana.  This dataset
is incomplete and a work in progress, as sites are GPS'd as they are inspected.  This dataset contains
information that represents what had been recorded, processed, and archived by IDEM personnel at a time
previous to publication.  However the data set may be incomplete and/or inaccurate due to the
ever-changing status of managed facilities and sites, and due to the data collection and processing efforts of IDEM staff.
It is an ever-changing work in progress.  Data were collected by the Solid Waste Compliance section within
the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The Section was also responsible
for collecting attribute information for each location. The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no
formal tests were performed on accuracy.  Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Omissions or
null values in certain fields is due to the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or
deleting attribute information) as the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out,
or the field with the ommission was not relative to the method used to collect the data."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile OPEN_DUMP:

"The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system. The accuracy of the
coordinates should be from 1-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment
(ie., multipath, SNR, and PDOP), and the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy
cannot be guaranteed or verified.  Each GPS unit should have been configured within the specifications of the
manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field personnel would configure the unit outside of specifications if
environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by logging both Maximum PDOP and the standard deviations
of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value was &gt; 6, the value for the "In_specs"
field was input as "NO". If the standard deviation was &gt; 8, the corrected GPS file was analyzed for signs of
multipath and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the archive. If the data set was
uneditable it was still left in the archive.  The "In-specs" field was changed to "No" and the location could
have an accuracy &gt; 5 meters.

If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection as defined by the
technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then the accuracy of the collected coordinates
should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5 meters (post-processed),
the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters (post-processed), and the Pro XR has a range of .50 cm - 1m differential accuracy to
real-time differential correction.

If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those given by the
manufacturer."

      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile OPEN_DUMP:

"The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less
accurate than horizontal accuracy. The vertical accuracy for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error.  However,
this accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values have been recorded, but it is strongly
suggested that the values not be used for any analysis.

Due to the nature of how these values are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large enough
to make the coordinate values unuseable in any type of locational analysis."

into ESRI ArcMap 8.2 and the following columns were deleted from the associated attribute table: HORIZONTAL, NORTHING, EASTING,
STANDARD_D, LOCATION_A, POSTAL_COD, and COUNTY_NAM. The shapefile was also visually checked to ensure that all data points provided
actually fell within the accepted IGS state boundary. IGS personnel then saved the edited shapefile as OPEN_DUMPS_IDEM_IN.
It should also be noted that portions of the associated metadata provided by IDEM for OPEN_DUMP were extracted and included

IGS personnel received an updated ESRI geodatabase (and metadata) named "OLQ_GPS_DATA_IGS.MDB" from IDEM personnel
(Shane Moore) on April 25, 2005. OLQ_GPS_DATA_IGS.MDB was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.0 and the
subset of data containing open dump site locations was exported to an ESRI shapefile format. The
shapefile was visually checked to insure that all data points provided actually fell within the accepted IGS
state boundary. The shapefile was then edited by removing the following fields from the associated attribute
table: HORIZONTAL, NORTHING, EASTING, STANDARD_D, LOCATION_A, POSTAL_COD and COUNTY_NAM. IGS personnel then
saved the edited shapefile as OPEN_DUMPS_IDEM_IN.SHP to follow internal naming conventions.

IGS personnel received an updated ESRI geodatabase (and metadata) named "GPSDATA_UPDATES.MDB" from IDEM personnel
(Shane Moore) on July 27, 2006. GPSDATA_UPDATES.MDB was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 9.0 and the
subset of data containing open dump site locations was exported to an ESRI shapefile format. The
shapefile was visually checked to insure that all data points provided actually fell within the accepted IGS
state boundary. The shapefile was then edited by removing the following fields from the associated attribute
table: HORIZONTAL, NORTHING, EASTING, STANDARD_D, LOCATION_A, POSTAL_COD and COUNTY_NAM. IGS personnel then
saved the edited shapefile as OPEN_DUMPS_IDEM_IN.SHP to follow internal naming conventions.

No changes in this dataset were apparent from the last update date on July 27, 2006 so only the metadata was

This metadata file was pre-parsed and parsed using CNS (Chew and Spit, v. 2.6.1) and MP (Metadata
Parser, v. 2.7.1) software written by Peter N. Schweitzer (U.S. Geological Survey). The errors generated
by MP were all addressed and corrected, except that no values were assigned to "Abscissa_Resolution"
and "Ordinate_Resolution."
