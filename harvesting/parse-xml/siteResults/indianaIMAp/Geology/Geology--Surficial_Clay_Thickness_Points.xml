CLAY_ILITH_PTS_IN is a point shapefile that shows total thickness of clay, as derived from logs of
water wells in the state of Indiana. (It presents the source data used to create a grid named "CLAY_ILITH_IN"
in a shapefile format.) The data were obtained from the iLITH Database of the Indiana Geological Survey.
The following explanation of the iLITH Database appears in Open-File Study 00-8 of the Indiana Geological
Survey:

"iLITH is a Microsoft Access database containing GIS capabilities that allows users to interact with
a portion of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Water-Well Record Database. iLITH
differs from the IDNR database in that lithologic descriptions and drilling contractor names have
been standardized, locational information for ~104,000 water-well logs has been verified, and the
spatial information in the database has been standardized for use with USGS digital elevation data
and US Census Bureau Tiger data. The iLITH graphical interface facilitates efficient interaction
between the user and the database."

Using Microsoft Access, queries were constructed that summed the total thickness of clay units for
each well. Units with the following designations were included in the summation: "clay," "clay and
gravel," "clay and sand," "clay and stone," "clay with gravel," "clay with gravel seams," "clay with
sand," "clay with sand streaks," "mud," "mud and gravel," and "mud and sand." Some inconsistencies
in the database were eliminated. The resulting table was then exported from Microsoft Access and
imported into ESRI ArcView to construct a point shapefile.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
CLAY_ILITH_PTS_IN was derived from the coverage named "CLYTHKPTS." Because
clay layers can constitute capping and confining units for aquifers, such layers are of hydrologic
significance. Water wells are usually drilled to the uppermost major water-bearing unit and are not
typically drilled through the entire thickness of surficial unconsolidated materials. Therefore, logs
of water wells provide a source of data regarding the vertical distribution of coarse- and fine-
grained materials above the water-bearing unit. This map layer was created to provide an overview of
the distribution of clay the state of Indiana.

The following discussion is from Open-File Study 00-8 of the Indiana Geological Survey: "...more
than 78,000 unique lithologic descriptions in the IDNR database were parsed into five new fields.
New data for each field were produced from lookup tables constructed by IGS geologists. The primary
lithology field condensed basic field descriptions into 44 lithologic units, but the new parsed data
remains very similar to the terminology of the original lithologic descriptions. To make the
lithologic information more manageable in plotting or cross section software, IGS geologists reduced
the new 44 primary lithologies to 19 interpreted lithologies."

About 200,000 additional water-well logs exist, but these were not utilized in the construction of the
iLITH Database or CLYTHKGRD because of incomplete locational or lithological information.

The following discussion is from Open-File Study 00-8 of the Indiana Geological Survey: "...the
location information for each record was verified by comparing the different types of location
information that are collected by the IDNR. Public Land Survey System (PLSS) descriptions were
compared to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. If a discrepancy greater than 1000
feet was identified, the record was removed from the new dataset.... This method is an error
checking procedure and doesn't assume that either location is accurate."

The vertical positional accuracy was not a factor in the digital
