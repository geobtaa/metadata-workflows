INDUSTRIAL_MINERALS_ACTIVE_2016_IN.SHP is a point shapefile that shows the locations of operation for industrial minerals producers that were active in 2016 in Indiana.
These operations extract and (or) produce the following commodities: cement, clay and shale, crushed stone, dimension limestone, dimension sandstone,
gypsum, lime, peat, slag, and sand and gravel. The data set contains location, contact information, geologic information, and other relevant information for all industrial
minerals operations known to be active in Indiana on 20160415.
</abstract>
      <purpose>INDUSTRIAL_MINERALS_ACTIVE_2016_IN.SHP was created to provide information about active industrial minerals producers in 2016 in Indiana, that suitable for use in a GIS.</purpose>

This shapefile represents more than 90 percent of industrial mineral operations that were active in Indiana in 2016. Some operations may have been omitted that were
not subject to federal or state regulation because of their relatively small size and (or) because of their lack of adverse effects on the environment. The primary source
of information for the data set was the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration. Other sources included the Indiana Mineral Aggregates Association
membership directory, telephone listings, aggregate source lists compiled by the Indiana Department of Transportation, company websites, neighboring businesses, the
Indiana Secretary of State’s website, conversations with geologists, and information from the Executive Director of the Indiana Mineral Aggregates Association.

Location data were verified by past geologist visits to the industrial minerals operations, checked against U.S.
Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic maps, and checked against satellite images. Locations of 4 of the new operations were verified from information
provided by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration because they were so new that they were not yet displaying on online maps.

During the summer of 2001, staff of the Mineral Resources Section of the Indiana Geological Survey conducted field work to collect mine location data using a Trimble
GeoExplorer III GPS unit. These data were downloaded to Trimble Pathfinder Office for processing and exported as an ESRI ArcView shapefile. The theme attribute table
was converted to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet named "ACTIVEMINES2001.XLS." Company and commodity data from the 2001 Directory of Industrial Mineral
Producers in Indiana were directly entered into that spreadsheet.

The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet ACTIVEMINES2001.XLS was saved as a dBase III file named "ACTIVEMINES2001.DBF." The file ACTIVEMINES2001.DBF was added to an ESRI ArcView
project as a table. The "Add Event Theme" and "Convert to Shapefile" functions were used to import the table into an ArcView View and to convert the table to a shapefile
INDUSTRIAL_MINDERALS_ACTIVE_2001_IN.

The shapefile INDUSTRIAL_MINDERALS_ACTIVE_2001_IN was then edited in ESRI ArcView. Of the 363 records in ACTIVEMINES2001.XLS there were 320 records that
had complete locational information in the form of UTMx and UTMy coordinates. Records without such locational information were deleted from the shapefile.
Of the 320 records with complete locational information, there were 314 records that had complete information regarding the name of the mine, pit, quarry, plant,
and (or) company. Points lacking such information were deleted from the shapefile.

Additional editing of the shapefile INDUSTRIAL_MINDERALS_ACTIVE_2001_IN was then conducted. The following fields were added: Commodity1, Commodity2, and Commodity3.
Using the "Calculator" function, values in the field named "Commodity1" were set equal to values in the field named "Type." Records having no locational information
but that had company information were used to fill in the fields Commodity2 and Commodity3. Finally, the following fields were then removed from the shapefile: Type,
Quadrangle, Qtr, Sec, T, R, County_nam, Longitude, Latitude, and Number.

The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet "IMDIR10.XLS" was saved as a comma-delimited text file named "IMDIR10.TXT." IMDIR10.TXT was then added to an Esri ArcMap
document, and the "Display XY Data" function was used to display the data using the UTM Zone 16, NAD 1983 latitude and longitude values contained in the
original database. The layer named "LANDSURVEY_STATE_BOUNDARY_IN.SHP" was also loaded into ArcMap to ensure that all points generated from the X-Y coordinates
were located within the geographic region of Indiana. The "Data &gt; Export Data" function was then used to produce an Esri point shapefile named
"INDUSTRIAL_MINDERALS_ACTIVE_2001_IN.SHP" to conform to the file-naming conventions of the IGS. Finally, the following fields were then removed from the attribute
table of the shapefile: "Record_ID," "Quadrangle," "Sec_Twp," "County," and "Map_ID_Num."

original database. The layer named "LANDSURVEY_STATE_BOUNDARY_IN.SHP" was also loaded into ArcMap to ensure that all points generated from the X-Y coordinates
were located within the geographic region of Indiana. The "Data &gt; Export Data" function was then used to produce an Esri point shapefile named
"INDUSTRIAL_MINDERALS_ACTIVE_2016_IN.SHP" to conform to the file-naming conventions of the IGS. Finally, the following fields were then removed from the attribute
table of the shapefile: "Record_ID," "Quadrangle," "Sec_Twp," "County," and "Map_ID_Num."

This metadata was pre-parsed and parsed using CNS (Chew and Spit) and MP (Metadata Parser) software written by Peter N. Schweitzer (United States Geological Survey).
The errors generated by MP were all addressed and corrected, except that no values were assigned to "Abscissa_Resolution" and "Ordinate_Resolution."

        <attrdef>
A unique source number assigned by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) for a particular producer
of road construction materials. Some numbers within this range are not currently being used by an active producer. Not all producers
have INDOT source numbers (values of zero). A producer with an INDOT source number is not a certified aggregate producer unless it also
has a "Certified Aggregate Producers Program" (CAPP) number.

        <attrdef>
Certified Aggregate Producers Program number (Indiana Department of Transportation). Indicates that an aggregate
producer has completed requirements of the Certified Aggregate Producer Program and has received certification to provide materials for
Indiana Department of Transportation projects. The number is a unique number assigned by INDOT for a particular producer. All numbers
are preceded by the letter Q. The first two numbers indicate the year that the operation received certification. A missing number within
the range indicates either that the number has been assigned to a producer that has not yet completed all requirements of the CAPP
program, or that a certified producer is not currently producing. Not all producers have CAPP numbers.
