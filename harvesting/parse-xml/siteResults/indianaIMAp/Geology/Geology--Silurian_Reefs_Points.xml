      <abstract>
SILURIAN_REEF_POINTS_MM54_IN is a point shapefile that shows the locations of Silurian rock reef
formations in Indiana. These data include five categories: (1) buried reef masses, (2) exposed reef,
(3) exposed reef in active stone quarries, (4) reef-induced structure in overlying rocks, and
(5) reef-induced structure in overlying rocks related to oil, gas, and gas storage fields.

This shapefile can be used in conjunction with SILURIAN_REEF_POLYGONS_MM54_IN.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
SILURIAN_REEF_POINTS_MM54_IN was created to provide a digital shapefile of the locations of Silurian
rock reef data in the state of Indiana, suitable for use in a GIS, from a preexisting published paper
map (Ault, C.H., Becker, L.E., Droste, J.B., Keller, S.J., and Shaver, R.H., 1992, Map of Indiana
Showing Thickness of Silurian Rocks and Location of Reefs, Indiana Geological Survey Miscellaneous
Map 54).

This shapefile can be used in conjunction with SILURIAN_REEF_POLYGONS_MM54_IN.

The digital shapefile was derived with minor modifications from a preexisting published paper map
(Ault and others, 1992) and is assumed to embody the same definitions and generalizations as were used
in the creation of the published map.

No records exist regarding horizontal positional accuracy of this shapefile. The coordinates used
in georeferencing this shapefile were derived from a shapefile named LANDSURVEY_STATE_POLY_IN that
was created by the Indiana Geological Survey at a source scale of 1:24,000.

The following note appears on the published source map (Ault and others, 1992): "Base modified from
U.S. Geological Survey Base Map of Indiana; 1950." No quantitative tests were performed.

A paper copy of the map titled "Map of Indiana Showing Thickness of Silurian Rocks and Location of Reefs, Indiana Geological
Survey Miscellaneous Map 54" was scanned using a wide-bed color scanner at the Indiana Geological Survey. The scanned TIFF image was
then loaded into ESRI's ArcMap 8.3 and georeferenced using the shapefile named LANDSURVEY_STATE_POLY_IN that was created at a scale of
1:24,000 by the Indiana Geological Survey, to obtain control points in UTM Zone 16, NAD 83 coordinates. The georeferenced image was then used as a backround image
at the approximate on-screen zoom scale of 1:356,000. ESRI's ArcCatalog was then used to create an empty shapefile named
SILURIAN_REEF_POINTS_MM54_IN. SILURIAN_REEF_POINTS_MM54_IN was then loaded into ESRI's ArcMap where an edit session was
started and all data points were manually digitized. The shapefile table was then attributed with information obtained from the
backround image file. All edits were then saved to the shapefile SILURIAN_REEF_POINTS_MM54_IN.
