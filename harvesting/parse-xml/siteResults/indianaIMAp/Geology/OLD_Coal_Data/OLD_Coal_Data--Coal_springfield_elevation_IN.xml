      <abstract>
A series of reports on coal resources of selected counties in Indiana were published as part of the
Special Report series of the Indiana Geological Survey between 1985 and 1994. These reports included
maps showing elevation of the Springfield Coal Member (Petersburg Formation, Pennsylvanian). The
elevation maps were based on coal-test records and interpretations of geophysical logs that are
included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists
of the Indiana Geological Survey and elevation contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps
were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (1:126,720). Following completion of the investigations,
the work maps showing elevation contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting
county coverages were then compiled into a single multi-county coverage. Elevations are given in feet,
and the contour interval is 20 feet. Since the completion of this shapefile, additional data on coalbed
elevations in selected areas has been obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey; interested users may
wish to contact the Indiana Geological Survey for information on these more up-to-date sources.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
COAL_SPRINGFIELD_ELEVATION_IN was created to provide a multi-county digital shapefile, suitable for use in a GIS, from
preexisting paper maps that were used in publications of the Indiana Geological Survey.

COAL_SPRINGFIELD_ELEVATION_IN (Polygon layer) contains internal attributes with designations that refer to minimum and maximum
values (in feet) of various elevation ranges, while an associated shapefile named
"COAL_SPRINGFIELD_ELEVATION_IN_LINES" (Line layer) contains internal attributes with
designations that refer to specific elevation values for contour lines (in feet). The designations are
the same as those appearing on the unpublished work maps from which the shapefile was derived.

Thickness and structure maps of coalbeds are compiled primarily from three sources of data: (1) logs from
coal-test drilling, (2) interpretations of geophysical logs, and (3) mine-map notations. The accuracy,
precision, and distribution of these three types of data vary greatly. Mine-map notations are probably
the most accurate, followed by drilling logs of good quality. Interpretations of geophysical logs have
been used where no other publicly available data exist (see detailed discussion below). Because all three
types of data were used in the compilation of this shapefile, the user should assume that attribute values
are no better than that achievable from the least accurate and precise (i.e., interpretations of
geophysical logs). Original maps of some of the underground mines in Indiana are on file at the Indiana

Paper work maps (1:126,720) that had been compiled for various investigations of coal resources in
counties of west-central Indiana were gathered. The paper maps were then scanned, using a black-and-
white wide-bed scanner, to digital raster images. The raster images were vectorized, using a tracer
program, to create a coverage named "SP_EL." The vector data was georeferenced to UTM Zone 16, NAD27.
The polygon coverages were then attributed, using the same values as appear on the work maps. The
various county coverages were then appended into a single multi-county coverage.

The original coverage, SP_EL, was first reprojected using NAD83. This coverage was then clipped to
another coverage named "INCLP83," which contains the area within the state boundary of Indiana
compiled at a scale of 1:24,000. The resulting
coverage is named "SP_EL_IN." Since SP_EL_IN and INCLP83 boundaries did not coincide perfectly with
one another, some polygons along the state boundary were either slightly truncated or slightly extended
to the new boundary.  In every case, the modifications were minor.

Bureau of Mines and Mining, Vincennes, Indiana (1-812-882-7242.) Copies of many of the maps (as
microfiche and photographic prints) are on file at the Indiana Geological Survey, and the mine-map data
that was used in the compilation of this shapefile were derived from that source. Notations regarding
coalbed thicknesses and geologic discontinuities appear on some maps. Logs from coal-test holes tend to
be clustered in areas of past or current mining. During the 1960s geophysical logs of oil-test holes
began to be used more extensively to map coal reserves.  Most logs of oil-test holes are spontaneous-
potential and resistivity logs; the low resolution and the small scale of these logs make estimating coal
thickness difficult, and different rock types may produce similar curves. Despite these difficulties, the
abundance of geophysical logs and the lack of other sources of data for large areas of potential economic
interest have led to an increased reliance on such logs for preliminary mapping of the thickness and
structure of coalbeds. Even the depth and thickness of coals as determined by coal-test holes drilled by
coal companies must be used with caution. Most drilling included in the public files has been done by
rotary or power-auger methods. Rock cuttings rather than cores are recovered with rotary drilling, and
the thickness of coal seams is estimated from the time of the first and the last appearance of coal
cuttings in the drilling fluid.
