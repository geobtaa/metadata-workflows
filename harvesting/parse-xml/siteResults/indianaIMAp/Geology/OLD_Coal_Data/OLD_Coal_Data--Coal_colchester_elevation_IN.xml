      <abstract>
From 1985 to 1994, a series of reports on coal resources of selected counties in Indiana was published
as part of the Special Report series of the Indiana Geological Survey. These reports included maps
showing elevation of the Colchester Coal Member (Linton Formation, Pennsylvanian). The elevation
maps were based on coal-test records and interpretations of geophysical logs and mine-map notations
that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal
geologists of the Indiana Geological Survey and elevation contours were drawn by hand. The original
work maps were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (1:126,720.) Following completion of the
investigations, the work maps showing elevation contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and
the resulting county coverages were then compiled into a single multi-county coverage. Elevations are
given in feet, and the contour interval is 20 feet. Since the completion of this shapefile, additional
data on coalbed elevations in selected areas have been obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey;
interested users may wish to contact the Indiana Geological Survey for information on these more
up-to-date sources.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
COAL_COLCHESTER_ELEVATION_IN was created to provide a multi-county digital shapefile, suitable for use in a GIS, from
preexisting paper maps, some of which were used in publications of the Indiana Geological Survey.

COAL_COLCHESTER_ELEVATION_IN contains internal attributes with designations that refer to minimum and maximum
values (in feet) of various elevation ranges, and an associated shapefile named "COAL_COLCHESTER_ELEVATION_IN_LINES"
contains internal attributes with designations that refer to specific elevation values for contour
lines (in feet). The designations are the same as those appearing on the unpublished work maps from
which the shapefile was derived.

Thickness and structure maps of coalbeds are compiled primarily from three sources of data: (1) logs
from coal-test drilling, (2) interpretations of geophysical logs, and (3) mine-map notations. The
accuracy, precision, and distribution of these three types of data vary greatly. Mine-map notations
are probably the most accurate, followed by drilling logs of good quality. Interpretations of
geophysical logs have been used where no other publicly available data exist (see detailed discussion
below.) Because all three types of data were used in the compilation of this shapefile, the user should
assume that attribute values are no better than that achievable from the least accurate and precise
(i.e., interpretations of geophysical logs.) Original maps of some of the underground mines in Indiana
are on file at the Indiana Bureau of Mines and Mining, Vincennes, Indiana (1-812-882-7242.) Copies of most
of the maps (as microfiche and photographic prints) are on file at the Indiana Geological Survey, and
the mine-map data that was used in the compilation of this shapefile were derived from that source.
Notations regarding coalbed thicknesses and geologic discontinuities appear on some maps. Logs from
coal-test holes tend to be clustered in areas of past or current mining. During the 1960s geophysical
logs of oil-test holes began to be used more extensively to map coal reserves.  Most logs of oil-test
holes are spontaneous-potential and resistivity logs; the low resolution and the small scale of these
logs make estimating coal thickness difficult, and different rock types may produce similar curves.
Despite these difficulties, the abundance of geophysical logs and the lack of other sources of data
for large areas of potential economic interest have led to an increased reliance on such logs for
preliminary mapping of the thickness and structure of coal beds. Even the depth and thickness of
coals as determined by coal-test holes drilled by coal companies must be used with caution. Most
drilling included in the public files has been done by rotary or power-auger methods. Rock cuttings
rather than cores are recovered with rotary drilling, and the thickness of coal seams is estimated
from the time of the first and the last appearance of coal cuttings in the drilling fluid.

Paper work maps (scale, 1:126,720) that had been compiled for various investigations of coal resources
in counties of west-central Indiana were gathered. The paper maps were then scanned, using a black-and-
white wide-bed scanner, to digital raster images. The raster images were vectorized, using a tracer
program, to create a coverage named "CO_EL." The vector data were georeferenced to UTM Zone 16, NAD27.
The polygon coverages were then attributed, using the same values as they appear on the work maps. The
various county coverages were then appended into a single multicounty coverage.  An additional line
layer representing elevation contour values was derived from the single multicounty polygon layer.

The original coverage, CO_EL, was first reprojected to UTM zone 16, NAD83. This coverage was then clipped to
another coverage named "INCLP83," which contains the area within the state boundary of Indiana compiled
at a scale of 1:24,000. The resulting coverage is named "CO_EL_IN." Since CO_EL_IN and INCLP83 boundaries did not coincide perfectly with
one another, some polygons along the state boundary were either slightly truncated or slightly extended
to the new boundary.  In every case, the modifications were minor.
