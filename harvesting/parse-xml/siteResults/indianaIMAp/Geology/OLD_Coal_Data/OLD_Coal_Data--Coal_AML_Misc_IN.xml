AML_POINT, the predecessor of COAL_AML_MISC_IN, was derived from
preexisting AutoCAD files digitized by personnel of the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation.

This shapefile contains information that is related to two additional shapefiles produced by the
Indiana Geological Survey:

1) COAL_AML_FEATURES_IN: Abandoned Mine Lands Site, Miscellaneous Site Features in Indiana
(Indiana Geological Survey, 1:24,000, Polygon Shapefile).

2) COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN: Abandoned Mine Lands Site, Dangerous Highwalls in
Indiana (Indiana Geological Survey, 1:24,000, PolyLine Shapefile).

AML_POINT, the predecessor of COAL_AML_MISC_IN, is a 1:24,000-scale point-based ESRI ArcView shapefile that
shows the locations of point features associated with Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) sites in the coal
region of Indiana. AML_POINT includes point features from all Indiana sites listed on the
federal AML site inventory by personnel of the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. COAL_AML_MISC_IN includes
point features from all Indiana sites.
COAL_AML_MISC_IN includes attributes which allow the points to be differentiated based on point type
(mine entrances, equipment and (or) facilities, and hazardous and (or) explosive gasses), site type, and site number.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
COAL_AML_MISC_IN is a compilation of all point features associated with Abandoned Mine Lands (AML)
sites in Indiana. AML_POINT was compiled by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)
as part of a contract deliverable for the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. AML_POINT was generated from data digitized from 1:24,000
-scale topographic maps. All AML data included in AML_POINT are organized in a geographic information
system (GIS) using ESRI ArcInfo and ESRI ArcView software of the Environmental Systems Research Institute
(ESRI) on the Windows NT and Windows 2000 platforms. AML_POINT includes attributes which allow the
points to be differentiated based on site type (AML, Bond Forfeiture, or Lost Surety), site number,
or site feature type (mine entrances, equipment and (or) facilities, and hazardous and (or) explosive gasses).

The AML site features included in COAL_AML_MISC_IN are associated with Abandoned Mine Lands
(AML) sites listed on the federal AML site inventory maintained by the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the
Indiana Division of Reclamation. All features from COAL_AML_MISC_IN have been identified and field-
verified by AML program personnel.

Two tests for attribute consistency were performed by IGS personnel using the QueryBuilder Tool in ESRI
Arcview.

(1) Completeness of values was verified.

- No values were left blank, unless appropriate. (In some instances an AML site is assigned a
federal number and no state (AML) number, or vice versa.

(2) Validity of values was verified.

- All features were attributed with values in the appropriate range and format.

AML_POINT was derived from preexisting AutoCAD files digitized by personnel of the Abandoned Mine Lands
program of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. Completeness of
AML_POINT is dependant on the completeness of the source data files. Spot-checks of areas during the
attributing process indicate that 95% of the point site features shown on the original federal AML site
inventory maps are represented in AML_POINT.

No records exist regarding the horizontal positional accuracy of this shapefile. AML_POINT was
derived from preexisting AutoCAD files digitized by personnel of the Abandoned Mine Lands program
of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. Horizontal positional
accuracy of AML_POINT is dependant on the positional accuracy of the source data files. The source
AutoCAD files were originally digitized from data shown on 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. The
topographic map set, which constitutes the AML program's compilation of federally inventoried AML
sites, was designed to provide a diagrammatic tool for visualizing the types of features associated
with AML sites. Site features such as gob and slurry areas, shafts, pits, haulage roads, and
highwalls were, in most cases, simply sketched in their approximate location within the more
precisely located AML site boundaries. This means that the horizontal positional accuracy of
AML_POINT is probably most significantly affected by the lack of horizontal positional accuracy
associated with the source topographic maps. Because of the potential for horizontal positional
error associated with AML_POINT, it is recommended that this dataset be used only as an index to
point AML site features. If the detailed location of a specific AML site feature is needed, more
detailed information is available from the Indiana Division of Reclamation, Abandoned Mine Lands
program.

The vertical positional accuracy was not a factor in the creation
of COAL_AML_MISC_IN. No quantitative tests were performed.

AML_POINT was created at the IGS using digital CAD data provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation Abandoned Mine Lands Program. Although the origins of
the CAD data are somewhat uncertain, the general procedures are known. AML site boundaries and
site features (mine entrances, equipment/facilities, hazardous/explosive gasses, etc.) were
digitized using AutoCAD from 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. The CAD files were then georeferenced
to UTM Zone 16, NAD27 using tics from 1:24,000-scale topographic maps.

County-based AutoCAD .dwg files were converted to ESRI ArcView shapefiles using the 'convert to
shapefile' function in ESRI ArcView version 3.2. The ESRI ArcView shapefile points were then attributed
with several items including site number, site type, feature type, and source. The CAD files
included annotation layers which listed information for most of the sites. The source Federal
Abandoned Mine Lands Site Inventory Maps were consulted to obtain attributes for Points not
annotated in the CAD files. After all the county shapefiles had been attributed, the ESRI ArcView
Geoprocessing wizard was used to merge the county shapefiles to a single shapefile named
AML_POINT.

The original shapefile, AML_POINT, was first converted to a coverage named "AML_PT" using the
'SHAPEARC' command in ESRI ArcInfo.  AML_PT was then reprojected from NAD27 to NAD83 in ESRI ArcInfo using
the 'PROJECT' command, to create a coverage named "AML_PT_83." AML_PT_83 was clipped to a coverage
named "INCLP83," which contains the area within the county boundaries of the state of
Indiana, which was compiled at a scale of 1:24,000.  The Geoprocessing
Wizard in ESRI ArcView was used to perform the clipping operation to create the shapefile named
"COAL_AML_MISC_IN."
