      <abstract>
From 1985 to 1994, a series of reports on coal resources of selected counties in Indiana was published
as part of the Special Report series of the Indiana Geological Survey. These reports included maps
showing thickness of the Danville Coal Member (Dugger Formation, Pennsylvanian). The thickness maps were
based on coal-test records, mine-map notations, and interpretations of geophysical logs that are included
in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists of the Indiana
Geological Survey and thickness contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps were compiled at a
scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (scale, 1:126,720). Following completion of the investigations, the work maps
showing thickness contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting county coverages
were then compiled into a single multicounty coverage. Different thickness ranges were utilized in the
various counties; these thickness ranges (given in feet) are retained in the final map. Since the
completion of this shapefile, additional data on coal thicknesses in selected areas has been obtained by
the Indiana Geological Survey; interested users may wish to contact the Indiana Geological Survey for
information on these more up-to-date sources.

      <purpose>
COAL_DANVILLE_THICKNESS_IN was created to provide a multicounty digital shapefile, suitable for use in a GIS, from
preexisting paper maps that were used in publications of the Indiana Geological Survey.

COAL_DANVILLE_THICKNESS_IN contains internal attributes with designations that refer to minimum and maximum values
(in feet) of various thickness ranges. The designations are the same as those appearing on the
unpublished work maps from which the shapefile was derived.

Thickness and structure maps of coalbeds are compiled primarily from three sources of data: (1) logs
from coal-test drilling, (2) interpretations of geophysical logs, and (3) mine-map notations. The
accuracy, precision, and distribution of these three types of data vary greatly. Mine-map notations
are probably the most accurate, followed by drilling logs of good quality. Interpretations of
geophysical logs have been used where no other publicly available data exist (see detailed discussion
below). Because all three types of data were used in the compilation of this shapefile, the user should
assume that attribute values are no better than values derived from the least accurate and precise data
type (i.e., interpretations of geophysical logs). Original maps of some of the underground mines in Indiana are

Paper work maps (scale, 1:126,720) that had been compiled for various investigations of coal resources
in counties of west-central Indiana were gathered. The paper maps were then scanned, using a black-and-
white wide-bed scanner, to digital raster images. The raster images were vectorized, using a tracer
program, to create a coverage named "DA_TH." The vector data was georeferenced to UTM Zone 16, NAD27.
The polygon coverages were then attributed, using the same values as appear on the work maps. The
various county coverages were then appended into a single multicounty coverage.

The original coverage, DA_TH, was first reprojected using NAD83. This coverage was then clipped to
another coverage named "INCLP83," which contains the area within the state boundary of Indiana
compiled at a scale of 1:24,000. The resulting
coverage is named "DA_TH_IN." Since DA_TH_IN and INCLP83 boundaries did not coincide perfectly with
one another, some polygons along the state boundary were either slightly truncated or slightly extended
to the new boundary.  In every case, the modifications were minor.

on file at the Indiana Bureau of Mines and Mining, Vincennes, Indiana (1-812-882-7242.) Copies of
many of the maps (as microfiche and photographic prints) are on file at the Indiana
Geological Survey, and the mine-map data that was used in the compilation of this shapefile were derived
from that source. Notations regarding coalbed thicknesses and geologic discontinuities appear on some
maps. Logs from coal-test holes tend to be clustered in areas of past or current mining. During the
1960s geophysical logs of oil-test holes began to be used more extensively to map coal reserves.  Most
logs of oil-test holes are spontaneous-potential and resistivity logs; the low resolution and the small
scale of these logs make estimating coal thickness difficult, and different rock types may produce
similar curves. Despite these difficulties, the abundance of geophysical logs and the lack of other
sources of data for large areas of potential economic interest have led to an increased reliance on
such logs for preliminary mapping of the thickness and structure of coalbeds. Even the depth and
thickness of coals as determined by coal-test holes drilled by coal companies must be used with caution.
Most drilling included in the public files has been done by rotary or power-auger methods. Rock cuttings
rather than cores are recovered with rotary drilling, and the thickness of coal seams is estimated from
the time of the first and the last appearance of coal cuttings in the drilling fluid.
