AML_HIGHWALLS, the predecessor of COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN, was derived from preexisting AutoCAD files
digitized by personnel of the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Reclamation.

This shapefile contains information that is related to two additional shapefiles produced by the
Indiana Geological Survey:

1) COAL_AML_FEATURES_IN: Abandoned Mine Lands, Miscellaneous Site Features in Indiana (Indiana
Geological Survey, 1:24,000, Polygon Shapefile).

2) COAL_AML_MISC_IN: Abandoned Mine Lands, Entrances, Equipment, Facilities, and Dangerous Gasses
in Indiana, (Indiana Geological Survey, 1:24,000, Point Shapefile).

AML_HIGHWALLS, the predecessor of COAL_AML_HIGHWAYS_IN, is a 1:24,000-scale PolyLine-based ESRI ArcView
shapefile that shows the locations and extents of dangerous highwalls associated with Abandoned Mine
Lands (AML) sites in the coal region Indiana. AML_HIGHWALLS includes highwalls at all
Indiana sites listed on the federal AML site inventory by personnel of the Abandoned Mine Lands
program of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN
includes attributes that allow the highwalls to be differentiated, based on site type and site number.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN is a compilation of all dangerous highwalls associated with Abandoned Mine Lands
(AML) sites in Indiana. AML_HIGHWALLS was compiled by the Indiana Geological
Survey (IGS) as part of a contract deliverable for the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. AML_HIGHWALLS was generated from data
digitized from 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. All AML data included in AML_HIGHWALLS are organized
in a geographic information system (GIS) using ESRI ArcInfo and ESRI ArcView software of the Environmental
Systems Research Institute (ESRI) on the Windows NT and Windows 2000 platforms. AML_HIGHWALLS
includes attributes which allow the highwalls to be differentiated based on site type (AML, Bond
Forfeiture, or Lost Surety) and site number.

The highwalls included in COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN are associated with Abandoned Mine Lands (AML)
sites listed on the federal AML site inventory maintained by the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the
Indiana Division of Reclamation. All highwalls from COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN have been identified and field-
verified by AML program personnel.

Two tests for attribute consistency were performed by IGS personnel using the QueryBuilder Tool in ESRI
Arcview.

(1) Completeness of values was verified.

- No values were left blank, unless appropriate. (In some instances an AML site is assigned a
federal number and no state (AML) number, or vice versa.

(2) Validity of values was verified.

- All features were attributed with values in the appropriate range and format.

AML_HIGHWALLS was derived from preexisting AutoCAD files digitized by personnel of the Abandoned Mine
Lands program of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. Completeness of
AML_HIGHWALLS is dependant on the completeness of the source data files. Spot-checks of areas during
the attributing process indicate that 95% of the highwalls shown on the original federal AML site
inventory maps are represented in AML_HIGHWALLS.

No records exist regarding the horizontal positional accuracy of this shapefile. AML_HIGHWALLS was
derived from preexisting AutoCAD files digitized by personnel of the Abandoned Mine Lands program
of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. Horizontal positional
accuracy of AML_HIGHWALLS is dependant on the positional accuracy of the source data files. The
source AutoCAD files were originally digitized from data shown on 1:24,000-scale topographic maps.
The topographic map set, which constitutes the AML program's compilation of federally inventoried
AML sites, was designed to provide a diagrammatic tool for visualizing the types of features
associated with AML sites. In most cases, site features such as highwalls were simply sketched in
their approximate location within the more precisely located AML site boundaries. This means that
the horizontal positional accuracy of AML_HIGHWALLS highwalls is probably most significantly
affected by the lack of horizontal positional accuracy associated with the source topographic maps.
Because of the potential for horizontal positional error associated with AML_HIGHWALLS highwalls,
it is recommended that this dataset be used only as an index to linear AML site features. If the
detailed location of a specific highwall is needed, more information is available from the Indiana
Division of Reclamation, Abandoned Mine Lands program.

The vertical positional accuracy was not a factor in the creation
of COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN. No quantitative tests were performed.

AML_HIGHWALLS was created by IGS personnel using digital CAD data provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation, Abandoned Mine Lands Program. Although the origins of
the CAD data are somewhat uncertain, the general procedures are known. AML site boundaries and site
features (highwalls, etc.) were digitized using AutoCAD from 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. The
CAD files were then georeferenced to UTM Zone 16, NAD27 using tics from 1:24,000-scale topographic
maps.

County-based AutoCAD (.dwg) files were converted to ESRI ArcView shapefiles using the 'convert to
shapefile' function in ESRI ArcView. The ESRI ArcView shapefile PolyLines were then attributed with
several items including site number, site type, feature type, and source. The CAD files included
annotation layers which listed information for most of the sites. The source Federal Abandoned
Mine Lands Site Inventory Maps were consulted to obtain attributes for PolyLines not annotated
in the CAD files. After all the county shapefiles had been attributed, the ESRI ArcView Geoprocessing
wizard was used to merge the county shapefiles to a single shapefile named AML_HIGHWALLS.

The original shapefile, AML_HIGHWALLS, was first converted to a coverage named "AML_HIGH" using
the 'SHAPEARC' command in ESRI ArcInfo.  AML_HIGH was then reprojected from NAD27 to NAD83 in ESRI ArcInfo
using the 'PROJECT' command, to create a coverage named "AML_HIGH_83." AML_HIGH_83 was clipped to a
coverage named "INCLP83," which contains the area within the county boundaries of the state of
Indiana, which was compiled at a scale of 1:24,000.  The Geoprocessing
Wizard in ESRI ArcView was used to perform the clipping operation to create the shapefile named
"COAL_AML_HIGHWALLS_IN."
