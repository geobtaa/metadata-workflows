      <abstract>
BEDROCK_GEOL_MM48_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows bedrock geology of the state of Indiana
at a scale of 1:500,000. The mapped stratigraphic units include systems and selected groups,
formations, and other stratigraphic units.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
BEDROCK_GEOL_MM48_IN was created to provide a digital coverage of the bedrock geology of the state
of Indiana, suitable for use in a GIS, from a preexisting published paper map (Gray, H.H., Ault,
C.H., and Keller, S.J., 1987, Bedrock Geologic Map of Indiana, Indiana Geological Survey
Miscellaneous Map 48). The mapped stratigraphic units include systems and selected groups,
formations, and other stratigraphic units.
This particular version of the shapefile was produced by the Indiana Geological Survey as part of an effort to populate the
National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) with data in a digital form.
This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy and the Arizona Geological Survey
under Prime Award Number DE-EE0002850 and Sub-Award Number IN-EE002850.

The following note appears on the published source map (Gray et al., 1987): "Compiled from original
data and published sources. Principal responsibilities: Keller, northern Indiana; Ault, Silurian, Middle
Devonian, and Middle Pennsylvanian rocks; Gray, Upper Ordovician, Mississippian, and Lower Pennsylvanian
rocks. Kentland area from unpublished work by Daniel S. Tudor. Knox and older units on cross-sections from
unpublished work by John B. Droste. Drafted by Roger L. Purcell."

BEDROCK_GEOL_MM48_IN contains internal attributes with designations that refer to various bedrock
stratigraphic units. The designations are the same as those appearing on the published map from which the
shapefile was derived, with the following exception: within the field named "strata," the value of "D"
includes both "D" and "D1."

Two tests for attribute consistency were performed by IGS personnel:
(1) Values of each field were checked, using the QueryBuilder Tool in ESRI ArcView
(a) Completeness of values was verified
- All attribute values in the shapefile were confirmed to be present
on the paper source map.
- No values were left blank, unless appropriate.
(b) Validity of values was verified
- All values were checked for spelling and capitalization.
(c) Relationships between fields were verified
- The one-to-one relationship between values appearing in
"strata" and "group" were verified, using the following example
query statement:
([Strata] = "P2") and ([Group] &lt;&gt; "Carbondale Group").
(2) Using ESRI ArcView, the attributes of the shapefile were visually compared
with a paper copy of the published source map. Such a comparison was
made for every polygon.

The digital shapefile was derived with minor modifications from a preexisting published paper map

used in the creation of the published map.

georeferencing GEO500 (the predecessor of BEDROCK_GEOL_MM48_IN) were derived from the same Mylar separate
(1:500,000 scale) as the geologic polygons. The following note appears on the published source map

The attributes of this shapefile were derived by comparison with the attributes of the source paper map and the lines of the
source Mylar separate.

In the middle 1990s, the Mylar separate that had been used in the publication of Indiana Geological
Survey Miscellaneous Map 48 was acquired. The Mylar separate, which is on file with the Technology
Transfer Section of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS), was then scanned by IGS personnel, using a
black-and-white wide-bed scanner, to a digital raster image. The raster image was vectorized, using a
tracer program. The vector data was georeferenced to UTM Zone 16, NAD27. The polygon coverage, named
"GEO500," was then attributed, using the same stratigraphic designations that appear on Indiana
Geological Survey Miscellaneous Map 48.

The original coverage, GEO500, was first reprojected from UTM zone 16, NAD27 to UTM zone 16, NAD83
using ESRI ArcInfo (v 8.1). This coverage was then clipped to another coverage, INCLP83, containing
the area within the 92 county boundaries for the state of Indiana, which was compiled at a scale of
1:24,000. Since GEO500 and INCLP83 boundaries did not coincide perfectly with one another, some
polygons along the state boundary were either slightly truncated or slightly extended to the new boundary.
In every case, the modifications were minor. The resulting coverage was converted to a shapefile
named "BEDROCK_GEOL_MM48_IN."
