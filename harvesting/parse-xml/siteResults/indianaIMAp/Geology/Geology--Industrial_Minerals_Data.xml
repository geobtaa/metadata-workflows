The Microsoft Access database from which this shapefile was derived was compiled from
paper files (namely, drillers' logs, mine samples, core logs) in the Mineral Resources Section of the
Indiana Geological Survey. Data from these files were first compiled in an Excel spreadsheet that was
converted into the Access database.

      <abstract>
INDUSTRIAL_MINERALS_POINTS_IN is a shapefile that shows the distribution of
stratigraphic data for various industrial minerals in Indiana.
These data were derived from six different types of sources: cores, measured samples, mine samples,
outcrops, quarries, and well logs. Data that are associated with each point can be obtained by contacting
the Indiana Geological Survey and referencing the identification number stored in the field named "ID__."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The purpose of this shapefile is to provide a map layer showing the distribution
of publicly available industrial mineral data in Indiana.

The data that are included in this shapefile were obtained from field geologists of the Indiana
Geological Survey (IGS), contracted drillers, and literature sources that were judged to be reliable
by geologists of the IGS.

Some data were interpreted by more than one geologist. In such cases, the data point may be duplicated,
allowing both interpretations to be included in the database.

This shapefile includes all industrial mineral data points in the files of the
Indiana Geological Survey within Indiana.

Locations were obtained by using Geographix software, which converts locational data from the Congressional
Survey System to UTM coordinates. In some cases footage information was available, and this was used in the
conversion. Where footage information was not available, the point was located to the center of the smallest
quarter-section given.

Paper files were scanned and converted into Corel WordPerfect documents using optical character recognition.
The WordPerfect documents were then saved as Microsoft Word documents. The Word documents were assigned a numerical
file name of eight characters, of which the first two numbers are the county Federal Identification (FID) number.
Data that are associated with each point can be obtained by contacting the Indiana Geological Survey and referencing the
identification number stored in the field named "ID__."

The Word documents described above contain locational information that was copied into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

The Excel spreadsheet was converted to a TXT document, and Geographix software was used to determine UTM coordinates
for each record in the TXT document.

Paper records were consulted and corrected locational information was entered wherever possible for records which were
not assigned UTM coordinates by Geographix software.

The TXT document with corrected UTM coordinates was then re-processed using Geographix software.

Fields were then added to the TXT document to indicate the sources of the data. The paper records of industrial minerals
data are contained within folders with labels such as "Quarry," "Core," or "Other." Some folders have two or more
designations, while other folders are unmarked. The fields were named "Quarry," "Core," "Other," and "Unmarked," and
for each record, the value "X" was added in the field (or fields) from which the associated paper record was obtained.

The TXT document was converted into a point shapefile using ESRI ArcView 3.3. The shapefile was named
INDUSTRIAL_MINERALS_POINTS_IN.
