from derivative products of the "Compendium of Paleozoic rock-unit stratigraphy in Indiana—a revision: Indiana Geological Survey
Bulletin 59 (1986)." The names of some groups, formations, and members on some of the maps have been updated to reflect the most

BEDROCK_GEOL_RGM_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows the bedrock geology of the state of Indiana, produced from the Indiana Geological Survey
Regional Geologic Map series, which was mapped at a scale of 1:250,000. The mapped stratigraphic units include selected systems,
groups, and formations. Additional attributes were included from derivative products of the "Compendium of Paleozoic rock-unit
stratigraphy in Indiana—a revision: Indiana Geological Survey Bulletin 59 (1986)." The names of some groups, formations, and members on some
of the maps have been updated to reflect the most recent nomenclature.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
BEDROCK_GEOL_RGM_IN was created to provide a seamless statewide coverage of the bedrock geology of the state of Indiana, suitable
for use in a GIS, from the IGS Regional Geologic Map series of preexisting published paper maps (eight maps in total). The mapped stratigraphic
units include selected systems, groups, and formations. The mapping represents the state of knowledge of bedrock geology in Indiana at the time
of publication.

BEDROCK_GEOLOGY_RGM_250K_IN contains attributes with designations that refer to various bedrock stratigraphic units. The designations are the
same as those appearing on the published maps from which the shapefile was derived, with the following exception: within the field named "Unit,"
the value of "S" from RGM7 is "S1"; the value of "O" from RGM7 is "O2"; the value of "S" and "V" for the Springfield Coal Member is "PS"; the value
of "K" for the Kope Formation is "OK"; the value of "D" for the Dillsboro Formation is "OD"; the value of "W" for the Waldron Formation is "SW";
the value of "LC" for the Liston Creek Member is "SLC"; the value of "M" for the Mississinewa Member is "SM"; the value of "O2" from RGM6 is "O";
the value of "LB" for the Lower Block Member is "PLB"; the value of "WF" for the West Franklin Member is "PWF"; the value of "B" for the Buffaloville
Member is "PB."

Two tests for attribute consistency were performed by IGS personnel:

(1) Values of each field were checked for completeness and validity, using the Select by Attributes Tool in ESRI ArcGIS:

(a) Completeness of values was verified. All attribute values in the shapefile were confirmed to be present
on the paper source map. No values were left blank, unless appropriate.

(b) Validity of values was verified. All values were checked for spelling and capitalization.

(c) Relationships between fields were verified.

(2) Using ESRI ArcGIS, the attributes of the shapefile were visually compared with a paper copy of the published source map. Such a comparison was
made for every polygon.

Paper versions of the Indiana Geological Survey's Regional Geologic Map Series (RGM) were scanned to full-color TIFF images by IGS
personnel using a wide-bed scanner. To accentuate the geologic contacts and deemphasize map colors and
non-geologic labels, each image was then opened in Adobe Photoshop and adjustments to the color saturation and
contrast were made. Next, the images were converted to black and white. The black and white images were then opened in ESRI ArcMap and
georeferenced to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Zone 16, NAD83 coordinate system and datum, using
LANDSURVEY_SECTIONS_LINE_IN.SHP as the base map. The rectified black and white images were then viewed transparently with the original
color image in the background to serve as a reference. The "Raster Paintbrush" tool was then used to erase black pixels that did
not represent a geologic contacts and to add contacts where gaps existed. Next, in "Raster Cleanup" (ArcScan toolbar), the "dilation"
setting was used to thicken the geologic contacts, and settings for "Gap Closure Tolerance" were adjusted to connect broken or uncertain
contacts. The "Vectorization" tool was then used to convert the black and white rasters into polylines for each of the eight RGM maps.
Attributes were then assigned using the same stratigraphic designations that appear on the original RGM maps. The attributed polygon
shapefiles were then merged together to create a seamless statwide polygon shapefile named BEDROCK_GEOLOGY_RGM_250K_IN.SHP.
Some geologic contacts across edge boundaries had to be interpreted to create a seamless merged polygon shapefile. Also, in some cases,
only the base or top of a formation or member was mapped. For these units, the mapped contact was digitized as a polyline and a 1-meter
buffer was added to both sides of the line to produce a polygon.

BEDROCK_GEOLOGY_RGM_250K_IN.SHP was opened in ESRI ArcMap and attribute fields named "Unit," "Name," "Ages," "Rank," "AgeRank,"
"Lithology," "Lith_other," "Epochs," "Group," "Formations," "Members," and "Source" were added. Values were populated with
information contained in the legends of the Regional Geologic Maps and from the IGS publication named "Compendium of Paleozoic
Rock-Unit Stratigraphy in Indiana" (1986).
