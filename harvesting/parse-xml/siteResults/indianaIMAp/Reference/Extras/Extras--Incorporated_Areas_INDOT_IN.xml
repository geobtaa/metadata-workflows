INCORPORATED_AREAS_INDOT_IN is a polygon shapefile that contains incorporated area boundaries (Cities and Towns) in
Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), Graphics Engineering. The
data set provided by INDOT was in an ESRI shapefile format and was named "CORPLINE_INDOT_2003."
INCORPORATED_AREAS_INDOT_IN is attributed with incorporated names (and) area and perimeter numbers.
An updated version of this data set was provided to personnel of the IGS by INDOT personnel on September 13, 2006.
The updated data set provided was in an ESRI shapefile format, and was named "GISINFO.CORPLINE.SHP."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT, Graphics and Engineering for the source shapefile GISINFO.CORPLINE.SHP:

"The polygon shapefile represents the incorporated area boundaries ( Cities and Towns) in the State of Indiana.
Approximately 568 incorporated boundaries are represented within this data set."
</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was developed to delineate incorporated area boundaries for all the cities and towns in State of Indiana.</purpose>
      <supplinf>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT, Graphics and Engineering for the source shapefile GISINFO.CORPLINE.SHP:

"Polygon layer representing approximately 568 incorporated boundaries are within (+) or (-) 8 to 10 meters (26ft to 32 ft) of accuracy.
Source Maps of Road Inventory was utilized using the "latest dated" Active Maps as a basis for changing the corporation boundaries of
the Cities and Towns of each of the 92 counties of the State of Indiana. Visual alignment of the corporation boundaries was applied to
the DOQQ's."

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named CORPLINE_INDOT_2003 from INDOT personnel in April, 2004. CORPLINE_INDOT_2003 was loaded
into ESRI ArcView 3.3 and the following columns were deleted from the associated attribute table: OBJECTID, CORPFIX_C_, CORPFIX_C1, SHAPE_LENG, SHAPE_AREA,
BEGIN_DATE, END_DATE, EDIT_BY, AND NOTES. IGS personnel then saved the edited shapefile as INCORPORATED_AREAS_INDOT_IN.
It should also be noted that portions of the associated metadata provided by INDOT for CORPLINE_INDOT_2003 were extracted and included
in this metadata file.

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named GISINFO.CORPLINE from INDOT personnel on September 13, 2006. GISINFO.CORPLINE was loaded
into ESRI ArcMap and the following columns were deleted from the associated attribute table: OBJECTID, AREA, PERIMETER, CORPFIX_C_,
CORPFIX_C1, SHAPE_LE, SHAPE_AR_1, BEGIN_DATE, END_DATE, EDIT_BY, INC_NUMBER, and NOTES. Two new fields titled "AREA" and "PERIMETER" were added and
values were calculated using ESRI ArcMap scripts. IGS personnel then saved the edited shapefile as INCORPORATED_AREAS_INDOT_IN. It should also
be noted that portions of the associated metadata provided by INDOT for GISINFO.CORPLINE were extracted and included in this metadata file.
