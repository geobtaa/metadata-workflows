Digital line graphs (DLGs) of hypsography (surface elevations) from 7.5-minute (1:24,000 scale)
topographic maps were produced as a cooperative project between the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Data were obtained from the most recent
topographic maps of the USGS, as of 2002. These DLGs were processed by personnel of the
Indiana Geological Survey to produce GIS layers and grouped into their respective 30' x 1°
quadrangle blocks. Major and minor code attributes were simplified for ease of use.

CONTOURS_24K_USGS_ADRIAN is a shapefile containing elevation contours produced at a scale of
1:24,000, grouped into a 30' x 1° quadrangle block. Elevation values are in feet.

The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLGs of map
features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources... All DLG data distributed by
the USGS are DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a full range of attribute codes,
have full topological structuring, and have passed certain quality-control checks."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This shapefile is a digital representation of elevation contours shown on 7.5-minute (1:24,000 scale)
topographic quadrangle maps of the United States Geological Survey. It has been processed into a GIS layer
with simplified attributes for ease of use.

The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"DLGs depict information about geographic features on or near the surface of the Earth, terrain, and
political and administrative units. These data were collected as part of the National Mapping Program."

Elevation values are derived from original DLG attributes obtained from the
United States Geological Survey and are assumed to be accurate. For contours with more
than one elevation value (where the  field named ELEV_NO is greater than 1), values were summed and
an average value was calculated and recorded in the field named ELEV.

NOTE: Some lines appear to have elevation values that are too small or too large for the range of
elevations found within the quadrangle. Furthermore, elevation values of "0" (zero) or "-9999" are
associated with boundaries, such as quadrangle boundaries, surface-mine boundries, and lake shores.

No tests were performed.

The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"Topological requirements include: lines must begin and end at nodes, lines must connect to each other
at nodes, lines do not extend through nodes, left and right areas are defined for each line element and
are consistent throughout the file, and the lines representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free
of gaps. The tests of logical consistency were performed by the USGS PROSYS program. The neatline was
generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the
digital file. All data outside the enclosed region were ignored and all data crossing these geographically
straight lines were clipped at the neatline. Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline were
snapped to the neatline. Neatline straightening aligned the digitized edges of the digital data with the
generated neatline, that is, with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates. All internal
areas were tested for closure using PROSYS."
</logic>
    <complete>
All vector lines appearing on USGS DLGs are present. Lines where the field ELEV equals zero are not
elevation contours; these lines represent boundaries, such as quadrangle boundaries, surface-mine
boundries, and lake shores. Attribute values have been modified for ease of use from the original DLGs.
For contours with more than one elevation value (where the  field named ELEV_NO is greater than 1),
values were summed and an average value was calculated and recorded in the field named ELEV.

The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"For Digital Revision Status = Not revised: Data completeness reflects the content of the source quadrangle.
Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility
constraints. For Digital Revision Status = Limited Update: This file has undergone limited update digital
revision. The file contains only: those features that are photoidentifiable on monoscopic source, supplemented
with limited ancillary source, and those features, present on the original source quadrangle, that can not be
reliably photoidentified but that are not considered particularly prone to change. For Digital
Revision Status = Standard Update: This file has undergone standard update digital revision. The data completeness of
this file meets NMD standards for feature content."

The DLG files were converted to ESRI coverages using ESRI ArcGIS 8.3 ArcToolbox.
Nearly all of the Indiana files were in UTM Zone 16, NAD27 coordinates.
The coverages were converted from the NAD27 coordinates to UTM
Zone 16, NAD83 coordinates using ESRI ArcToolbox.

Individual quadrangle coverages were modified by adding blank
major and minor pairs, as necessary, to make the same attribute
structure in all 7.5-minute quadrangle areas within a 1:100,000 quadrangle area.

The following commands were used to move elevation values from the minor
fields to new fields named ELEV, ELEV_TOT, and ELEV_NO. ELEV_TOT was later
deleted. In cases where there were more
than four major and minor codes, an iterative process was used. Any minor fields
which had the code for a depression contour (611) were converted
to "YES" values in a field named SINK.

Commands:

*/delete any preexisting fields in the cover.aat table

dropitem w_frankfort.aat elev sink elev_tot elev_no

*/add and define the fields elev,sink,elev_no, and elev_tot

additem w_frankfort.aat elev 6 6 i

additem w_frankfort.aat sink 3 3 c

additem w_frankfort.aat elev_no 2 2 i

additem w_frankfort.aat elev_tot 8 8 i

*/move the data from the appropriate minor pair to the new field

sel w_frankfort.aat

resel major1 = 22

calculate elev_tot = minor1

calculate elev_no = 1

asel

resel minor1 = 611

move 'YES' to sink

asel

resel major2 = 22

calculate elev_tot = minor2 + elev_tot

calculate elev_no = 1 + elev_no

asel

resel minor2 = 611

move 'YES' to sink

asel

resel major3 = 22

calculate elev_tot = minor3 + elev_tot

calculate elev_no = 1 + elev_no

asel

resel minor3 = 611

move 'YES' to sink

asel

resel major4 = 22

calculate elev_tot = minor4 + elev_tot

calculate elev_no = 1 + elev_no

asel

resel minor4 = 611

move 'YES' to sink

asel

*/ calculate the final elev value by dividing the sum of all elevations

*/ (elev_tot), by the number of elevations per line (elev_no)

resel elev_no &gt; 0

calculate elev = elev_tot / elev_no

asel

A "clean-up macro was then run to drop the unnecessary fields.

dropitem muncie.aat muncie.aat major1 minor1 major2 minor2

dropitem muncie.aat muncie.aat major3 minor3 major4 minor4

dropitem muncie.aat muncie.aat elev_tot

After these commands were run, the ESRI coverage was converted to an ESRI shapefile
using ESRI ArcGIS 8.3 ArcCatalog. Attribute fields specific to the coverage format
were dropped from the shapefile.
