US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata reports -

"The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)
is compete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong
to the "Geometry and Topology" (GT) class of objects in the "Spatial
Data Transfer Standard" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are
topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain
relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
requirements.  These requirements include:

* Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.

* Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.

* Complete chains do not extend through nodes.

* Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain
element and are consistent throughout the extract process.

* The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.

The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical
consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.
The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update
System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census
TIGER data base.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for
states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding
spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for
logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original
Census TIGER data base files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided
to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining
FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been
fully tested for consistency."

US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata reports -

"The information present in these files is provided for the purposes
of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates
in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but
the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies
with the source materials used, but generally the information is
no better than the established national map Accuracy standards
for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);
thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications
such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses
that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's
surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy
standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,
1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of
most of the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the
1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding
(GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan
areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The
Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of
what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan
areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that
enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census
TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature
shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made
other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local
participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy
of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal,
State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain
information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared
by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional
accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-
decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision
allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed
in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without
overlap."

US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata reports -

"In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER
data base in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the
Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information
from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically
consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by
the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census
TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the
Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent
area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical
equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length
record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either
line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census
Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files
since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature
and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate
updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous
version." "TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS
environment.  The environment consists of two Alpha Server
8400s clustered together running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used
for production operations.  The Census TIGER system is driven
by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures which invoke C
software routines to extract selected geographic and cartographic
information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational Census TIGER data base."
