COUNTY_LAND_PARCELS_IDHS_IN is an ESRI Geodatabase polygon feature class that contains land parcels maintained by county agencies in Indiana, provided by
personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) as of June 29, 2009, and subsequently updated on September 30, 2009, December 2, 2009, December 28,
2009, February 2, 2010, March 5, 2010, April 6, 2010, October 11, 2010, November 19, 2010, March 22, 2011, September 8, 2011, January 30, 2012, June 8, 2012,
August 27, 2012, April 27, 2013, November 22, 2013, January 19, 2014, October 14, 2014, June 22, 2015, and December 17, 2015. This data set was provided by IDHS
in ESRI feature class named "County_Parcels." These data were compiled by IDHS as part of the IndianaMap Data Sharing Initiative between IGIC, Indiana Office
of Technology (IOT), Indiana Geographic Information Office (GIO), Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS), Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) and participating
Indiana counties to provide the most accurate framework data (including address points, street centerlines, land parcels, and governmental boundaries) for the
citizens of Indiana. More information is available at the following Web URL: http://www.igic.org/news/index.php?itemid=265
</abstract>
      <purpose>
This data set was developed to provide accurate framework data (including address points, street centerlines, land parcels, and governmental boundaries)for Indiana,
as part of the IndianaMap Data Sharing Initiative.

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named "County_Parcels.shp" from IGIC personne (Phill Worrall) on September 1, 2012
(harvested on August 27, 2012). "County_Parcels.shp" was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 10.0 and the data were examined for completeness.
The following fields were deleted from the attribute table; "Source_FeatureID," "Source_Datadesc," "Current_Status." The shapefile was
then exported to an ESRI file geodatabase named COUNTY_LAND_PARCELS_IDHS_IN.GDB to conform to IGS naming conventions.
