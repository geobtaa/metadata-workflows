Digital line graphs (DLGs) of hypsography (surface elevations) from 7.5-minute (1:24,000 scale) topographic maps were produced as
a cooperative project between the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Data were
obtained from the most recent topographic maps of the USGS, as of 2015. These DLGs were processed by personnel of the Indiana
Geological Survey to produce an Esri File Geodatabase that covers the entire state of Indiana.

CONTOURS_24K_USGS_IN.GDB is an Esri File Geodatabase containing elevation contours produced at a scale of 1:24,000, grouped into three line feature
classes named "Contours_24K_Hardlines," "Contours_24K_Major_50Ft," and "Contours_24K_Minor." Annotation feature classes ("Anno_16K" and "Anno_3_10")
are also present to aid the user in labeling the contour data inside GIS software. Elevation values are in feet.

The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLGs of map features are converted to digital form
from maps and related sources... All DLG data distributed by the USGS are DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a full range
of attribute codes, have full topological structuring, and have passed certain quality-control checks."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
CONTOURS_24K_USGS_IN.GDB is a digital representation of elevation contours shown on 7.5-minute (1:24,000 scale) topographic quadrangle maps of the United
States Geological Survey. The USGS DLG data has been processed into an Esri File Geodatabase with simplified attributes for ease of use. The following
is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"DLGs depict information about geographic features on or near the surface of the Earth, terrain, and political and administrative units. These data
were collected as part of the National Mapping Program."

Elevation values are derived from original DLG attributes obtained from the United States Geological Survey and are
assumed to be accurate. For contours with more than one elevation value (where the field named ELEV_NO is greater than 1), values were summed
and an average value was calculated and recorded in the field named ELEV.

NOTE: Some lines appear to have elevation values that are too small or too large for the range of elevations found within the quadrangle.
Furthermore, elevation values of "0" (zero) or "-9999" are associated with boundaries, such as quadrangle boundaries, surface-mine boundries,
and lake shores.

    <logic>
No tests were performed.

The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"Topological requirements include: lines must begin and end at nodes, lines must connect to each other at nodes, lines do not extend
through nodes, left and right areas are defined for each line element and are consistent throughout the file, and the lines representing
the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency were performed by the USGS PROSYS program. The
neatline was generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file.
All data outside the enclosed region were ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines were clipped at the
neatline. Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline were snapped to the neatline. Neatline straightening aligned the digitized
edges of the digital data with the generated neatline, that is, with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates. All
internal areas were tested for closure using PROSYS."
</logic>
    <complete>
All vector lines appearing on USGS DLGs are present. Lines where the field ELEV equals zero are not elevation contours; these lines
represent boundaries, such as quadrangle boundaries, surface-mine boundries, and lake shores. Attribute values have been modified
for ease of use from the original DLGs. For contours with more than one elevation value (where the field named ELEV_NO is greater
than 1), values were summed and an average value was calculated and recorded in the field named ELEV.

The following is extracted from metadata of the United States Geological Survey for the original DLGs:

"For Digital Revision Status = Not revised: Data completeness reflects the content of the source quadrangle. Features may have
been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. For Digital Revision Status = Limited
Update: This file has undergone limited update digital revision. The file contains only: those features that are photoidentifiable
on monoscopic source, supplemented with limited ancillary source, and those features, present on the original source quadrangle,
that can not be reliably photoidentified but that are not considered particularly prone to change. For Digital Revision Status = Standard
Update: This file has undergone standard update digital revision. The data completeness of this file meets NMD standards for feature content."

A total of 34 Digital Line Graph (DLG) files were originally supplied to the Indiana Geological Survey by personnel of the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources. All of these files were used to construct the file geodatabase named "Elevation_Contours_24K_USGS.GDB." All processing was
performed in Esri ArcCatalog. Elevation_Contours_24K_USGS.GDB contains three line feature classes named "Contours_24K_Hardlines,"
"Contours_24K_Major_50Ft," and "Contours_24K_Minor." An annotation feature class was also created and is named "Anno_16K."
