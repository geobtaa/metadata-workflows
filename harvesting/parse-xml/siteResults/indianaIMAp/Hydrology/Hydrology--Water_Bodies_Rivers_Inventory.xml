      <abstract>
Dataset includes all Indiana river reaches on the Nationwide Rivers
Inventory (NRI) listed by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The file was
created using 1:100,000 scale data from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD),
therefore, the lines remain in the NHD reaches, resulting in multiple line
segments for each NRI listing. The line segments have NOT been dissolved.
The start and end point of each listing segment is approximate and located by
described landmarks.

The following excerpt from the NPS, NRI website describes the eligibility for a
river to be listed-

In order to be listed on the NRI, a river must be free-flowing and
possess one or more Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs). Thus, the
eligibility analysis consists of an examination of the river's hydrology,
including any man-made alterations, and an inventory of its natural,
cultural, and recreational resources. There are a variety of methods to
determine whether certain resources are so unique, rare or exemplary as to
make them outstandingly remarkable. The determination that a river area
contains ORVs is a professional judgment on the part of the
interdisciplinary study team (IDT), based on objective, scientific
analysis. Input from organizations and individuals familiar with specific
river resources should be sought and documented as part of the process.
In order to be assessed as outstandingly remarkable, a river-related value
must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a
comparative regional or national scale. Dictionary definitions of the
words "unique" and "rare" indicate that such a value would be one that is
conspicuous example from among a number of similar values that are
themselves uncommon or extraordinary. Only one such value is needed for
eligibility.”

Accuracy is determined by the source website
listing the classifications, outstanding river values (ORVs), and descriptions of each NRI river.  Two
exceptions include: (1) Two records for the Little Blue River
which appear to encompass the same stretches of river.  The attributes of these
two records were combined and represented here as a single record.  (2) One
record of the Wabash River does not have any outstanding values recorded
in the original data.  This is a known error because all listed rivers
must have at least one ORV.  It is suspected by the comments to be
outstanding for fishing, recreation, and history, but in order to be true
to the source, assumptions are not made and the fields are left blank.

Data are consistent with the 1:100,000 National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).  There are
no known overlaps or line gaps. Each line segment ends at intersections. Lines remain
in the individual reaches consistent with the NHD and have not been dissolved to
reflect singular NRI listings.

Scenery - The landscape elements of landform,
vegetation, water, color, and related factors result in notable or
exemplary visual features and/or attractions. When analyzing scenic
values, additional factors -- such as seasonal variations in vegetation,
scale of cultural modifications, and the length of time negative
intrusions are viewed -- may be considered. Scenery and visual
attractions may be highly diverse over the majority of the river or
river segment.

Recreation - Recreational opportunities are, or have
the potential to be, popular enough to attract visitors from throughout
or beyond the region of comparison or are unique or rare within the
region. Visitors are willing to travel long distances to use the river
resources for recreational purposes. River-related opportunities could
include, but are not limited to, sightseeing, wildlife observation,
camping, photography, hiking, fishing and boating. (1) Interpretive
opportunities may be exceptional and attract, or have the potential to
attract, visitors from outside the region of comparison. (2)The river
may provide, or have the potential to provide, settings for national or
regional usage or competitive events.

phenomenon that is unique or rare within the region of comparison. The
feature(s) may be in an unusually active stage of development, represent
a "textbook" example, and/or represent a unique or rare combination of
geologic features (erosional, volcanic, glacial, or other geologic

Fish - Fish values may be judged on the
relative merits of either fish populations, habitat, or a combination of
these river-related conditions. (1) Populations- The river is nationally
or regionally an important producer of resident and/or anadromous fish
species. Of particular significance is the presence of wild stocks
and/or federal or state listed (or candidate) threatened, endangered or
sensitive species. Diversity of species is an important consideration
and could, in itself, lead to a determination of "outstandingly
remarkable." (2) Habitat- The river provides exceptionally high quality
habitat for fish species indigenous to the region of comparison. Of
particular significance is habitat for wild stocks and/or federal or
state listed (or candidate) threatened, endangered or sensitive species.
Diversity of habitats is an important consideration and could, in
itself, lead to a determination of "outstandingly remarkable."

Wildlife - values may be judged on the merits
of either terrestrial or aquatic wildlife populations or habitat or a
combination of these conditions. (1) Populations- The river, or area
within the river corridor, contains nationally or regionally important
populations of indigenous wildlife species. Of particular significance
are species considered to be unique, and/or populations of federal or
state listed (or candidate) threatened, endangered or sensitive species.
Diversity of species is an important consideration and could, in itself,
lead to a determination of "outstandingly remarkable." (2) Habitat- The
river, or area within the river corridor, provides exceptionally high
quality habitat for wildlife of national or regional significance,
and/or may provide unique habitat or a critical link in habitat
conditions for federal or state listed (or candidate) threatened,
endangered or sensitive species. Contiguous habitat conditions are such
that the biological needs of the species are met. Diversity of habitats
is an important consideration and could, in itself, lead to a
determination of "outstandingly remarkable."

Prehistory - The river, or area within the river

use by Native Americans. Sites must have unique or rare characteristics
or exceptional human interest value(s). Sites may have national or
regional importance for interpreting prehistory; may be rare and
represent an  area where a culture or cultural period was first
identified and  described; may have been used concurrently by two or
more cultural groups; and/or may have been used by cultural groups for
rare sacred purposes. Many such sites are listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, which is administered by the NPS.
