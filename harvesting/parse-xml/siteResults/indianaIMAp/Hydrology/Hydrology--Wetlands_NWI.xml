The following is excerpted from the "Wetlands Product Summary" Web page of the USFWS:

"As of May of 2014, the wetland geospatial data layer provides on-line map information for all of the conterminous U.S., Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, Guam, the major Northern Mariana Islands and 35% of Alaska. This has been accomplished by working with numerous public and private
cooperators to produce maps, digital data, and publications. Currently, efforts are underway to complete and maintain a seamless digital wetlands data
set for the Nation. This effort constitutes the Wetlands Data Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure."

WETLANDS_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP provides the extent and locations of wetlands and deepwater habitats in Indiana.

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:

"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These
data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the
National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include
seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some
deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go
undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or
that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types
of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands Project Metadata layer, which contains
project specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project
boundaries."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:

"The present goal of the Service is to provide the citizens of the United States and its Trust Territories with current geospatially referenced information
on the status, extent, characteristics and functions of wetlands, riparian, deepwater and related aquatic habitats in priority areas to promote the understanding
and conservation of these resources."

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:

"Digital wetlands data are intended for use with base maps and digital aerial photography at a scale of 1:12,000 or smaller. Due to the scale, the primary
intended use is for regional and watershed data display and analysis, rather than specific project data analysis. The map products were neither designed or
intended to represent legal or regulatory products. Questions or comments regarding the interpretation or classification of wetlands or deepwater habitats
can be addressed by visiting http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/FAQs.html These data were developed in conjunction with the publication Cowardin, L.M., V. Carter,
F.C. Golet, and E.T. LaRoe. 1979. Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States. U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife
Service, Washington, DC. FWS/OBS-79/31. Alpha-numeric map codes have been developed to correspond to the wetland and deepwater classifications described.
For more informtion on the wetland classification codes visit http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Wetland-Codes.html. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)
uses data standards to increase the quality and compatibility of its data. This approach increases the opportunity to share data and reduce occurrence of
redundant data development. These standards can be found at: http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Data-Standards and include the FGDC Wetlands Mapping Standard,
FGDC-STD-015-2009. Note that coastline delineations were drawn to follow the extent of wetland or deepwater features as described by this project and may not
match the coastline shown in other base maps. Any use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the
U.S. Government. Although this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant and Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM) file is intended
to document the data set in nonproprietary form, as well as in Arc/INFO format, this metadata file may include some Arc/INFO-specific terminology."

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:

"This data set represents the extent of wetlands and deepwater habitats that can be determined with the use of remotely
sensed data and within the timeframe for which the maps were produced. Wetlands are shown in all of the 50 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and Saipan. The accuracy of image interpretation depends on
the quality of the imagery, the experience of the image analysts, the amount and quality of the collateral data, and the
amount of ground truth verification work conducted. There is a margin error inherent in the use of imagery, thus detailed
on-the-ground inspection of any particular site, may result in revision of the wetland boundaries or classification,
established through image analysis. Wetlands or other mapped features may have changed since the date or the imagery and/or
field work. There may be occasional differences in polygon boundaries or classifications between the information depicted
on the map and the actual conditions on site."

Original stable base hard copy maps of wetland and deepwater habitats were created based on USGS state and quadrangle boundaries. These maps were converted
to digital files using various software packages (WAMS, ARC and others). The digital files were stored as ESRI Import/Export files corresponding to a single
1:24,000 USGS quadrangle. These digital files were imported and converted to ESRI Coverage format and checked for topological and attribute errors. All coverages
were converted from a UTM map projection to an Alber's Equal Area map projection and the horizontal datum was converted from NAD27 to NAD83 were necessary.
Polygons attributed as "Uplands" were removed from the dataset and polygons were merged at quadrangle boundaries where the quadrangle line divided polygons
with the same attribute. The data was loaded into a seamless SDE geodatabase for the conterminous United States. These steps were conducted using both Arc
Macro Language (AML) and ArcMap editing tools. All point data from the original ESRI Coverages were buffered by 11.28 meters (1/10 of an acre) and incorporated
into this polygon feature class. Linear features from the original ESRI Coverages were merged at quadrangle boundaries where the quadrangle line divided lines
with the same attribute. Linear data is stored in a separate feature class. Further data improvements included the conversion of all old wetland codes that
contained 'OW' to the new code containing 'UB'. All polygons labeled as 'OUT', 'No Data' and 'NP' were removed from the database.

Personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) downloaded an ESRI shapefile named "IN_SHAPEFILE_WETLANDS" on October 20, 2014, from the following URl:
[ http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/State-Downloads.html ]. It was opened in Esri ArcCatalog and examined for completeness, and was then renamed "WETLANDS_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP"
to follow internal naming conventions of the IGS. WETLANDS_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP was then re-projected using ArcCatalog, from the original "NAD_1983_Albers" coordinate system
to the "NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_16N" coordinate system. It should also be noted that portions of the metadata provided with the source data were used to construct
the metadata document for WETLANDS_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP.

Alphanumeric code identifying the wetland classification of the polygon. The wetland classification codes are a series of letter and number codes
that have been developed to adapt the national wetland classification system to map form. These alpha-numeric codes correspond to the classification nomenclature
(Cowardin et al. 1979) that best describes the habitat. (for example, PFO1A). Currently there are over 7,000 code combinations in the dataset with over 14 million
possible permutations of the code. For information on the wetland codes visit: http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Wetland-Codes.html.
