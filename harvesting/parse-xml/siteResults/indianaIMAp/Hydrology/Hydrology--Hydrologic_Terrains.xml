This shapefile was slightly modified from a coverage that was the basis for the following report:
Fleming, A.H., Bonneau, P., Brown, S.E., Grove, G., Harper, D., Herring, W., Lewis, E.S.,
Moeller, A.J., Powell, R., Reehling, P., Rupp, R.F., and Steen, W.J., 1995.  Atlas of
Hydrogeologic Terrains and Settings of Indiana, Indiana Geological Survey, Final Report to
the Office of Indiana State Chemist, Open-File Report 95-7.
The coverage that was created by Fleming et al. was also included in the following CD-ROM
publication:
Indiana Natural Resources and Environmental GIS Data, Office of Indiana State Chemist,
Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1154, Bernie Engel (contact).

      <abstract>
HYDROGEOL_SETTINGS_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows hydrogeologic terrains and settings of Indiana.
The methodology of the investigation and definitions of terms are described in an associated report
(Indiana Geological Survey, Open-File Report 95-7).
</abstract>
      <purpose>
HYDROGEOL_SETTINGS_IN was derived from a coverage named "HGS."  HGS was created to provide
a coverage showing generalized interpretations of regional hydrostratigraphic and hydraulic relationships
in Indiana, as mapped at a scale of 1:100,000. The coverage was created by the Indiana Geological Survey
as a product deliverable for an investigation funded by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.

Internal attributes are based on work maps of Fleming et al. (1995). Data were derived chiefly
from water well records, supplemented locally by records of test borings and oil and gas wells,
seismic data, rotary cuttings, and down-hole natural gamma-ray logs. Settings are generalized
interpretations based on available data. Map units and contours represent an interpretation of
inherently variable geologic conditions. Boundaries are approximate and transitional by
definition. Conditions at specific sites may differ from those shown on the coverage.
Five polygons have unknown settings; eleven polygons have unknown terrains.

The geologic boundaries are transitional by definition, consequently their positions at the scale of
the coverage are only a general approximation. Conditions at a specific site may differ from those
shown on the coverage. The coverage is intended for use at the published scale (1:100,000) and should
never constitute the sole source of information for a site-specific investigation. Five polygons have
unknown settings; eleven polygons have unknown terrains.

No records exist regarding the horizontal positional accuracy of this coverage. The coordinates
used in georeferencing HYDROGEOL_SETTINGS_IN were derived from 1:100,000 USGS topographic quadrangle maps. The
geologic boundaries are transitional by definition, consequently their positions at the scale of
the coverage are only a general approximation. Conditions at a specific site may differ from those
shown on the coverage. The coverage is intended for use at the published scale (1:100,000) and

HGS was reprojected from UTM zone 16, NAD27 to UTM zone 16, NAD83 using ESRI ArcInfo (v 8.1). This coverage was then clipped to
another coverage named "INCLP83," a boundary coverage for the State of Indiana (compiled at
a scale of 1:24,000). Since HGS and INCLP83 boundaries did not coincide perfectly with one
another, some polygons along the state boundary were either slightly truncated or slightly
extended to the new boundary.  In every case, the modifications were minor. The resulting
shapefile was named "HYDROGEOL_SETTINGS_IN."

Map unit labels for hydrogeologic settings
A NOTE ON GEOLOGIC NAMES AND TERMINOLOGY: From Fleming and others, 1994 and 1995:
"The Indiana Geological Survey, like many similar organizations, recognizes the need for
consistent usage of proper stratigraphic names for formations, landforms, and other
geologic entities, as spelled out by the Code of Stratigraphic Nomenclature. The
traditional policy has been to disallow printed use of any secondary, working tier of
informal terminology, based on the belief that such usage might ultimately lead to the
formalization of names that were never properly defined. Contrary to that policy, a
plethora of "names" for terrains, landscapes, hydrogeologic settings, and various internal
elements are used in this report. Relatively few formal names exist for glacial units in
Indiana, and most of those that do are based on traditional rock-stratigraphic concepts
or interpretations of landscapes that are, at best, marginally applicable to the broad,
sequence-based approach employed in this study. Moreover, no formal names have ever been
established for major hydrostratigraphic units or hydrogeologic settings in the state. The geographic
extents of the individual sequences and settings described in this report, and
the correlations of their major internal stratigraphic units beyond the immediate mapped
confines of their respective terrains, are commonly unknown. Therefore, most of the "names"
employed herein are part of an informal, working terminology for these glacial terrains,
hydrogeologic settings, and their stratigraphic elements. The surnames of these "names" are
uncapitalized to distinguish them from the few existing formal names that are used. In all
cases, these "names" must be recognized as informal nonentities. Prior to this study, many
of these "named" features represented "terra incognito", and the reconnaissance nature of
this study did not afford as complete a definition as might be desired. Consequently this
terminology is likely to remain in constant flux as new information is added and forces
different interpretations and classifications."
