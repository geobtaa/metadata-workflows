[ http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/State-Downloads.html ].

For the latest news from the USFWS please access the home page using the following link: [ http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/index.html ].

The following is excerpted from the "Wetlands Product Summary" Web page of the USFWS:

"As of May of 2014, the wetland geospatial data layer provides on-line map information for all of the conterminous U.S., Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, Guam, the major Northern Mariana Islands and 35% of Alaska. This has been accomplished by working with numerous public and private
cooperators to produce maps, digital data, and publications. Currently, efforts are underway to complete and maintain a seamless digital wetlands data
set for the Nation. This effort constitutes the Wetlands Data Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure."

WETLANDS_HISTORIC_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP provides the extent and locations of historic wetland habitats in Indiana.

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:

"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of historic wetland habitats in the conterminous United States. The U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the principal Federal agency that provides information to the public on the extent and status of the
Nation's wetlands and provides stewardship for the wetlands data that comprise the Wetlands Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure.
In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This
evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data
on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on
the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past
wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No
linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution. Since
these features no longer exist, boundary delineations are considered approximations based on topography, previously mapped information or indications
of historic water levels."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:

"The present goal of the Service is to provide the citizens of the United States and its Trust Territories with current geospatially referenced information
on the status, extent, characteristics and functions of wetlands, riparian, deepwater, historic and related aquatic habitats in priority areas to promote
the understanding and conservation of these resources."
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:

"The historic wetland maps were produced as topical overlays using U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps as the base. The data are intended for use
in publications, at a scale of 1:24,000 or smaller. Due to the scale, the primary intended use is for regional and watershed data display and analysis, rather
than specific project data analysis. The map products were neither designed or intended to represent legal or regulatory products. Any use of trade, product,
or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government. Although this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant
metadata file is intended to document the data set in nonproprietary form, as well as in Arc/INFO format, this metadata file may include some Arc/INFO-specific
terminology."

IN_SHAPEFILE_HISTORIC_WETLANDS.SHP was downloaded by IGS personnel on October 20, 2014 to update the wetlands information for
Indiana, and was obtained from the following URL: http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/State-Downloads.html

Personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) downloaded an ESRI shapefile named "IN_SHAPEFILE_HISTORIC_WETLANDS" on October 20, 2014, from the following URl:
[ http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/State-Downloads.html ]. It was opened in Esri ArcCatalog and examined for completeness, and was then renamed "WETLANDS_HISTORIC_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP"
to follow internal naming conventions of the IGS. WETLANDS_HISTORIC_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP was then re-projected using ArcCatalog, from the original "NAD_1983_Albers" coordinate system
to the "NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_16N" coordinate system. It should also be noted that portions of the metadata provided with the source data were used to construct
the metadata document for WETLANDS_HISTORIC_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP.
