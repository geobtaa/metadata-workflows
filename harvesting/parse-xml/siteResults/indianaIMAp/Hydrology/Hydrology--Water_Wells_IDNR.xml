NOTE: The original data set named WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_100217.SHP was provided to Indiana Geological
Survey personnel on February 17, 2010, personnel from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of
Water, Resource Assessment Section.

NOTE: An updated data set named WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_120312.SHP was provided to Indiana Geological
Survey personnel on March 15, 2012, by Mr. Michael P. Martin, GIS Coordinator, Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, Division of Outdoor Recreation.

NOTE: An updated data set named WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_130530.SHP was provided to Indiana Geological
Survey personnel on July 23, 2013, by Mr. Michael P. Martin, GIS Coordinator, Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, Division of Outdoor Recreation.

NOTE: An updated data set named WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_160616.SHP was provided to Indiana Geological
Survey personnel on June 16, 2016, by Mr. Michael P. Martin, GIS Coordinator, Indiana Department
of Natural Resources, Division of Outdoor Recreation.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDNR for the source shapefile WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_160616.SHP:

"This file is a digital geospatial point feature class of both located water well records (which include UTM coordinates) and
unlocated water well records (without UTM coordinates as of 200911).  The estimated locations used for the unlocated wells
were based on the polygon centroid values for the smallest indicated section, quarter, quarter-quarter, or quarter-quarter-quarter
section (as indicated in the database) for over 250,000 water well records and for about 26,000 of the 250,000 water well records
the UTM's were obtained from address geocoding using the owners address, a generally more accurate method (see process steps below)."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDNR for the source shapefile WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_160616.SHP:

"The Division of Water Ground Water Database has approximately 400,000 water well records, and of those, approximately 145,000
have been field located and have x, y (UTM) coordinates.  The remaining records have no utms and cannot be easily utilized in
a GIS format.  The purpose of this shapefile was to include those wells with UTM coordinates and to approximate the UTM coordinates
for the others based on the most precise Township, Range, Section, quarter sections (TRS) locations available from office locating,
which is effectively the centroid of the smallest known section or quarter sections; thus, increasing the amount of data available
for display and analysis in a GIS format. This shapefile is combination of the located water well records and the water well records
for which an estimated location was able to be determined using the methods described below.  This leaves less than 15,000 records
with no UTM's associated with them. This shapefile and associated table has selected fields from the main digital water well database
that are typically needed for most research."

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDNR for the source shapefile WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_160616.SHP:

"Locations based only on the street address, driving directions, or other location information provided on the well record
are considered unlocated records and have no x, y coordinates, only township, range, section, and quarter-quarter-quarter
sections (if estimated).

"The x, y coordinates are from the calculated centroid of the smallest possible individual polygon that matched the water
well location data. Some records have no quarter sections and/or some of the polygons could not be subdivided, so the
centroid of the section was used for those water well records. These are the least accurate coordinates and in a regular
one-mile square section the x, y coordinates will generally be within a half-mile of the office located section, on
irregular sections, the distance may be greater. The best location values are on the records with quarter-quarter-quarter
sections and typically will be within 150 meters of the office located quarters.

"A small number of the data points were checked for accuracy and methods used should keep the x, y coordinates within the
proper section in most cases. However, due to the complexity and in cases redundancy in the public land survey system for
Indiana some x, y pairs may not be located in the proper section or even the proper county. Other sources of error may be
caused by misinterpretation of the driving directions or office locating.  Several areas have different survey systems than
the Congressional TRS (Clark Military Grant, Military Donations, Meridian Road Lines, Indian Treaties etc.) and no attempt
at this time was made to provide centroids for these areas.

"Located records were primarily field located based on the location identified on the USGS 1:24,000 7.5 minute series topo
map by the field locator. In some cases the structure or subdivsion may not be on the map and location is based on topography.
So some error may be inherent in the field locations and points placed on the map ( a single point on a map may be 100 feet
across). The scale is based USGS 1:24,000 7.5 minute series topographic maps. However, in most cases locations of mislocated
wells can have large errors, with the reported locations having no meaning."

Polygon shapefiles representing divisions in the Indiana PLSS were spatially joined to LANDSURVEY_COUNTY_POLY_IN.shp using a
one-to-many relationship, so sections and subsections on county boundaries could be identified. A new field was added to poly_q.shp, poly_qq.shp,
poly_qqq.shp, and Landsurvey_Sections_Poly_IN.shp called "CONCAT," which concatenated the following fields of the attribute tables:
TWP,TWPD,RNG,RNGD,PARCEL_ID,QTR,COUNTY. Each layer was then converted to points (polygon centroid locations). A check for duplicates in the CONCAT field
was conducted to verify the uniqueness of this field for matching against the water well log database. Several errors were found in LANDSURVEY_COUNTY_POLY_IN.shp
and were corrected before proceeding. Using the Calculate Geometry tool in ArcGIS, UTMX and UTMY values were calculated for each point in each section
and subsection data layer.

The DNR.DBF table obtained from IDNR was imported into a Microsoft Access database called IDNR_waterwells.mdb for processing. A query
was conducted to identify records with IDNR locations (UTM coordinates) and those without. A subset of the original fields were retained, including:
REFNO, COMPDATE, OWNER, COUNTY, TWN, RNG, QUAR1, QUAR2, QUAR3, SEC, DEPTH, STATIC, PUMPRATE, BAILERRT, WELLUSE, UTMX, UTMY. DBF attribute tables of
the section and subsection point files were imported to the Access database from the input shapefiles. A field called CONCAT was added to the unlocated
well-log table to concatenate the fields: TWN, RNG, QUAR1, QUAR2, QUAR3, SEC, COUNTY. Relationships were defined in Access using the CONCAT field for
the unlocated records and the section and subsection point locations. Queries were conducted for each subsection to assign UTM (NAD 27) coordinates to
each unlocated well record based on the best available PLSS location. A field was added to each output query table called "LOC_SRC" and populated with
the value "PLSS AND COUNTY MATCH" for each record matched with an estimated coordinate. A field was added to the query table for the located records
called "LOC_SRC" and populated with the value "IDNR-WATER" to denote that the locations were sourced from IDNR.

A table called ilith.dbf was imported into the Access database (IDNR_waterwells.mdb), and a query was performed to identify records
in the original IDNR database with locations corrected during the compilation of the iLITH database. Eight hundred and eighty (880) UTM coordinates in
the LOCATED table were replaced with iLITH locations and the LOC_SRC field for these records was populated with the value "ILITH." All water-well records
with estimated coordinates were appended into a single table called "matched." This table was then appended to the LOCATED table to produce a single table
with located and unlocated well records. In ArcGIS, the Add XY data utility was used to import the water-well locations (located and estimated). The data
were exported to a shapefile with an assigned projection of UTM NAD27 Zone 16, which is the native projection of all the IDNR and original iLITH locations.
The shapefile was then reprojected to UTM NAD83 Zone 16, and two new fields were added to the shapefile attribute table: UTMX83 and UTMY83. The Calculate
Geometry utility was used to calculate the new UTMX and UTMY coordinates for the new UTM 1983 datum. The UTM NAD27 coordinate fields were deleted from
the shapefile. The shapefile was clipped to the state boundary to retain only records contained within the boundary. The resulting shapefile was named
Waterwells_IDNR_IN.shp
