The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

"This data set is a complete digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Watershed (10-digit) 5th level for the NRCS business areas in and around the state of Indiana. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the "Federal Guidelines, Requirements, and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary data set; Chapter 3 of Section A, Federal Standards, Book 11, Collection and Delineation of Spatial Data; Techniques and Methods 11-A3" (04/01/2009). http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/data sets/watershed/index.html . Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, noncontributing areas and flow modification."
</abstract>
      <purpose>
The following is extracted from USDA, NRCS metadata --

"The Watershed and Subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The smaller sized 6th level sub-watersheds (up to 250,000 acres) are useful for numerous application programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The data set is seamless and, for the most part, a nationally consistant geospatial database."

"The WBD was produced using Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) as the source map. Data completeness for DRG files reflects content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in the completeness and accuracy of the WBD. The map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale digital raster graphic base maps, with an inherited error of +/- 40 feet according to the USGS National Map Accuracy Standards.
It is estimated that any errors detected were less than 10%. It should also be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used (i.e. natural water flow is downhill), the locations of boundaries are still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale DRGs do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries."

        <procdesc>The new WBD data set was reviewed on-screen by USGS, EPA, or NRCS personnel using DRGs and DOQs as base maps. Hydrologic Units that were less than 40,000 acres (for the 10-digit units) were reviewed, and, if possible, were dissolved out. Along the coastal areas classic watersheds that fell within the federal guidelines size criteria (10-digit: 40,000-250,000 acres) were broken out. If possible the remaining frontals were left as their own units. Hydrologic units what were greater than 250,000 acres (10-digit units) were reviewed. If possible these units were then broken down into smaller units that met the size criteria.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Original data set attribution was reviewed and revised to reflect the updates and changes made to the data set. These revisions to the attribution were also made to ensure that the data set met the Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries. The NHD was used during this process to help with the naming and downstream coding of each unit. In some instances there were name hydrologic unit name discrepancies between the NHD and what was printed on the DRGs. In these instances the DRGs were used instead of the NHD. The 12-digit watershed boundaries were used to dissolve to the 10-digit scale using the HUC10 attribute.</procdesc>

"The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the U.S.A.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture makes no claims for the suitability of the data for other purposes. U.S. Department of Agriculture should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The Watershed Boundary data set is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application of the data. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions they make.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data.  If enlarged, the maps will not include the fine detail that would be appropriate for mapping at the small scale.  Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data from the source distributor."
