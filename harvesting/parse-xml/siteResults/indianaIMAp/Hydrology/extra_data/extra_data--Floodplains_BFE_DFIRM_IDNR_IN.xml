Base Flood Elevations (BFE) are one layer in the interim digital flood rate insurance maps
(DFIRM) created by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and available for

      <abstract>
This line layer represents base flood elevations (BFEs) created from FEMA Flood Rate
Insurance Maps (FIRM). BFE lines indicate the rounded whole-foot water surface elevation
of the 1% annual chance flood. BFE lines are required in riverine AE zones. AE Zones are
areas inundated by 1% annual chance flooding (100-year flood), for which BFEs have been
determined.

Of 92 counties in Indiana, 86 are included in this DFIRM data set and 62 counties have BFE
information. The following 6 counties are omitted – Allen, DeKalb, Johnson, Lake, Marion,
Vanderburgh. These counties will be completed as work on the IDNR project progresses. This
floodplain data may be used with an associated floodplain polygon shapefile and cross sections
line shapefile.

IDNR documentation states -

“This database is an interim version of the Digital Flood Insurance Rate
Map (DFIRM) Database.  It does not fully meet all DFIRM specifications as
found in “Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners,
Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database”.
A fully compliant product is expected in 2005.

The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs),
previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard
analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data,
where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of
DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale
of 1:12,000.

The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the
FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping
applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database
that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.”

      <purpose>
IDNR documentation states –

“The purpose of this interim product is to provide much of the same
information as the paper FIRM while moving toward compliance with the
specifications found in “Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard
Mapping Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data
and DFIRM Database.

The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and
insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase
requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which "... requires the
purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by
Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies
or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities
located or to be located in identified areas having special flood
hazards," Section 2(b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.
In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs),
the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of
premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP.”

This dataset, as well as many others, was compiled
for mapping and download as part of the Web site titled "A GIS Atlas for Indiana,"
funded by the Indiana Department of Transportation. Many publicly
available datasets were created, edited, and compiled inclusion on the Web site
where users can download data or map online using ESRI ArcIMS. Many public data
sources, not created in conjunction with the statewide project, were obtained
by Web site download, contacting originators, and creating spatial files from
tabular data. A range of layer editing was used, specific to each layer, from full
creation, to data cleaning, to only reformatting metadata. The level of editing done
by BLA or the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) is fully disclosed in the process
steps of this metadata; credit for the information is retained by the originator.

IDNR documentation states –

“The DFIRM Database consists of countywide vector files and associated
attributes produced in conjunction with the hard copy FEMAFIRM. The
published effective FIRM and DFIRM maps are issued as the official
designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities
and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they
are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review,
appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better
match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this
type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries
is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping
process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and
Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners. Attribute accuracy was
tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a
symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent
quality control testing of FEMA’s DFIRM database was also performed.”

“Flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction
with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management.”
</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>
IDNR documentation states –

“When FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement
between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at
the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure
agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together
and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on
the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM.
However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM are rounded whole-foot
elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the
elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one
foot.”

FEMA’s Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners,
Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database
gives the following information reqarding BFE logical consistency (L-272).

"The BFE lines will have no visible gaps or overshoots between the SFHA
boundary and the end of the BFE line at the publication scale of the
DFIRM. However, the ends of the BFE lines are not necessarily snapped
precisely to the SFHA boundary.  Each BFE is represented by a single line.
While BFE lines are depicted as wavy lines on the hardcopy FIRM, the are
primarily strait lines in the spatial data, although they may bend."
</logic>
    <complete>
Only 62 of the 86 avialable county DFIRMs have a BFE layer, but all 86 counties
are listed in the place keywords to alert users that the BFE is not a part of
these DFIRMs, rather than the DFIRMs being unfinished as is the case in the 6 omitted counties.

IDNR documentation states –

“Data contained in the DFIRM Database files reflect the content of the
source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the
source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping,
FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces.
However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where
some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for
communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for
floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical
analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information
obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic
surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Both detailed and
approximate analyses are employed. Generally, detailed analyses are used
to generate flood risk data only for developed or developing areas of
communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to
occur, FEMA uses approximate analyses to generate flood risk data.
Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile are
studied.”

This metadata was pre-parsed and parsed using CNS (Chew and Spit, v 2.6.1) and MP (Metadata Parser, v 2.7.1)
software written by Peter N. Schweitzer (U.S. Geological Survey). The errors generated by MP were all
addressed and corrected, except that no values were assigned to "Abscissa_Resolution" and "Ordinate_Resolution."
