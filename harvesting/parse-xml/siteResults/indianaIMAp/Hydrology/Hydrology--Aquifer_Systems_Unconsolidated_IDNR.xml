This data set was provided to personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) on October 28, 2011 by the Division of Water, Indiana Department of Natural
Resources personnel. The data was provided in an ESRI shapefile format,and was named "AQUIFER_SYSTEMS_UNCONSOLIDATED_IDNR_IN.SHP". This file was approved
for public distribution by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), Division of Water (DOW). This map was compiled from multiple unpublished
work maps based on USGS quadrangles and at a 1:24,000 scale, and is intended for use at a scale of 1:48,000 or smaller.

AQUIFER_SYSTEMS_UNCONSOLIDATED_IDNR_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows unconsolidated aquifer systems of the state of Indiana at a scale of 1:48,000. The
following is excerpted from the IDNR DOW website, Aquifer Systems Mapping 1:48,000 &lt;http://www.in.gov/dnr/water/4302.htm&gt; Aquifer Systems Mapping Methods:

"The maps, with accompanying text and tables, describe characteristics such as geologic materials, thickness of confining units, aquifer thickness, static
water levels, well yield, typical well depths, and depth to the aquifer resource. The counties within the northern Basin Studies were adapted from that
series to complete statewide coverage in a uniform style. The basin study aquifer system names are unique and are described on those county map adaptations,
and in more detail within the cited publication. All of the unconsolidated mapping is intended for use at a scale of 1:48,000 or smaller."

      <purpose>
AQUIFER_SYSTEMS_UNCONSOLIDATED_IDNR_IN was created to provide a digital coverage of the unconsolidated (sand and gravel) aquifer systems of the state of
Indiana, suitable for use in a GIS, from new 2003-2011 county-based aquifer systems mapping and preexisting published paper maps (Water Resource Availability
in the St. Joseph River Basin, Indiana (1987); Water Resource Availability in the Kankakee River Basin, Indiana (1990); Water Resource Availability in the
Lake Michigan Region, Indiana (1994); and Water Resource Availability in the Maumee River Basin, Indiana (1996)).

The content of the attributes contained in this layer for the northern Basin Study counties of DeKalb, Elkhart, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, St. Joseph,
and Steuben; and for portions of Adams, Allen, Benton,Jasper, Kosciusko, Marshall, Noble, Pulaski, Starke, Wells, and White are as reported in Beaty and others;

Water Resource Availability in the St. Joseph River Basin, Indiana (1987);

Water Resource Availability in the Kankakee River Basin, Indiana (1990);

Water Resource Availability in the Lake Michigan Region, Indiana (1994);

and Water Resource Availability in the Maumee River Basin, Indiana (1996).

The remaining counties and portions thereof were mapped under the Aquifer Systems Mapping (1:48,000) project (2003-2011). The accuracy of the attributes for both the
northern Basin Study counties and the Aquifer Systems Mapping (1:48,000) project is not known. The accuracy of the reported aquifer characteristics is not intended to
represent site-specific conditions, but to identify types of aquifers and typical extents of sand and gravel units likely to contain and produce groundwater. The
thickness ranges and potential aquifer yield ranges are estimates of regional aquifer characteristics.

In conducting the mapping, hundreds of water well records were evaluated, especially those having relatively complete information on well location, construction, pump test,
and lithology. There were many areas in the counties with sparse information because of lack of well records or incomplete records. Few wells are being drilled in parts of
the county served by a public water system. County-based mapping in places show the surface coal mine area coverage (see Indiana Map, IGS COAL_MINE_SURFACE_IN shapefile)
and discuss groundwater potential for coal mine spoil areas. This is only available for individual counties on the IDNR DOW Aquifer Systems Mapping page at
http://www.in.gov/dnr/water/4302.htm.

The locations of many wells were field checked and the locations posted on 7.5 minute topographic maps. Visual confirmation of wells was not always possible. Many
locations were based only on the street address, driving directions, or other location information provided on the well record.

Mapping of the aquifer systems rely heavily on the IDNR/DOW digital water well record database (about 400,000 records available online) along with other
useful digital information (see Indiana Map) where available (e.g. seismic data, bedrock topography maps, soil surveys, oil and gas wells). In addition,
publications by the U.S. Geological Survey, Indiana Geological Survey, and other entities were very helpful. Relatively uniform characteristics are the
basis for the naming of an aquifer system. However, some variation between counties is possible. See a particular county of interest for specific details.
The original coverage, Unconsolidated Aquifer Systems Mapping (1:48,000) boundaries, was merged and the lines separating the units removed. The resulting
coverage was converted to a shapefile named "AQUIFER_SYSTEMS_UNCONSOLIDATED_IDNR_IN."  A polygon coverage was created and attributed, and the shapefile
provided to IGS personnel.
