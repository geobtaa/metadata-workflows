HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_UNCLASSIFIED_NHD_IN.SHP is derived from the feature class named "NHD_LOCALRES_UNCLASSIFIED_IN" of the Local-Resolution
National Hydrography Dataset, created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). Personnel of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) provided the Indiana Geological Survey an ESRI file
geodatabase named NHD_LOCALRES_131004_IN.MDB on October 8, 2013. This data was subsequently updated on December 16, 2013, March 27, 2014,
September 5, 2014, November 6, 2014, March 6, 2015, August 6, 2015, September 21, 2015, March 3, 2016, and November 30, 2016.

This dataset is complete and includes data for all of the following thirty-eight HUC08 subbasins in Indiana:
Auglaize (0410007), Blue-Sinking (05140104), Chicago (07120003), Driftwood (05120204), Eel (05120104), Eel (05120203),

HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_UNCLASSIFIED_NHD_IN.SHP is intended to be used with three associated shapefiles named
"HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_CLASSIFIED_NHD_IN.SHP," "HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_WATERBODYDISCRETE_NHD_IN.SHP ,"
and "HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_WATERBODYLINEAR_NHD_IN.SHP."

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named "NHD_LOCALRES_UNCLASSIFIED_IN":

"In order to meet the USGS NHD data model for flowlines, all new flowlines resulting from the Indiana NHD local
resolution upgrade project that could not be categorized (artificial path, canal/ditch, coastline, connector, pipeline, stream/river perennial,
stream/river intermittent, or underground conduit) were given an FTYPE of Stream/River and an FCODE of Stream/River (46000). Those features
are considered to be Unclassified Flowlines and were loaded into this dataset. Records from the reprojected NHDFlowline feature class where
FCODE = 46000 were loaded into this dataset. An 'INDIANA_CLASS' field was added to the feature class and all records were given a value
of 'Unclassified Flowline.' The FCODE and FTYPE fields were then deleted. All records from the source NHDFlowlines where FCODE &lt;&gt; 46000 can be
found in the Classified Flowline dataset."

"The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or
reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at
that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the
original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000
scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features,
flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the
approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the
National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee."

      <purpose>
The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named "NHD_LOCALRES_UNCLASSIFIED_IN":

"The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water
supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another
within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the
upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using
software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network
analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon
one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information
linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into
many different types of applications to the benefit of all."

"The accuracy of the attributes of the source 1:24,000 scale NHD cannot be verified but the Digital Line Graph (DLG)
data that the 1:24,000 scale NHD attributes come from is estimated to be 98.5 percent. Prior to conflation, the
Indiana Geographic Information Council's Waters Working Group reviewed the 1:24,000 scale NHD for the entire state
of Indiana and corrected GNIS name errors. As part of the conflation process, GNIS names on the local resolution NHD
reaches were validated against the 1:24,000 scale NHD. Prior to conflation, Feature types were checked against the
source 1:24,000 scale NHD. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National
Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database."

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named "NHD_LOCALRES_UNCLASSIFIED_IN":

"The reader should be aware that in preparing local-resolution NHD for the State of Indiana, AECOM Technology
Services, Inc. (ATS) has relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the information that has been provided
to it for review, and that no third party is entitled to rely upon ATS’ work product, as the work is intended
for the use of the client only. The completeness of the data reflects the HUC 8 level published in the WBD geodatabase.
Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized from the 1:24,000 scale NHD data because of scale
and legibility constraints. In general, streams were collected to the 6 acre basin limit, or the highest upstream
limit of the 1:24,000 scale NHD, whichever was greater. Features collected outside of the HUC 8 basin were done so
because newer terrain data shows that the HUC 8 basin limit is no longer accurate. Lake/pond features that were 10,890
square feet or greater in area, or that were part of the 1:24,000 scale NHD and were still visible in the imagery,
were collected. Swamp/marsh features were collected if a 1:24,000 scale NHD feature existed and could be verified in
the imagery. Ftypes of Pipeline with an Fcode of 42803 Pipeline: Pipeline Type = Aqueduct; Relationship to
Surface = Underground indicate urban areas in which stormwater data is unavailable, and 3 or more underground connections
could be inferred from the imagery and terrain data. Fcodes may have changed from the 1:24,000 scale NHD and have
been defined in agreement with the USGS and the Indiana Geographic Information Council’s Waters Working Group. Fcodes
will remain the same unless determined to have been incorrectly coded in the 1:24,000 scale NHD. All Stream/river features
that do not have a corresponding 1:24,000 scale NHD will have a generic Stream/river FCode. Note, however, that these
general rules were applied unevenly among basins during compilation. Transport reaches are defined on nearly all features
of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, and connector. Waterbody reaches are defined on all lake/pond features.
New local resolution NHD streams whose headwaters are in Indiana and flow into a bordering state were captured using imagery
and terrain data that overlapped into the adjacent state. The features were digitized until they reached the first
confluence within the 1:24,000 scale NHD feature. The 1:24,000 scale NHD reach that crossed the state boundaries was
then copied into the local resolution NHD dataset and broken at the new confluences. The entire reach was copied in order
for it to be coded as a "Modify" during the conflation process. New features whose head waters start in a bordering state
and flow into Indiana will start at the border. Features that start in a bordering state and meander in and out of the
state along the border are captured from the highest headwater intersection with the border and continue downstream only
if the feature confluences with another feature in Indiana. When a 1:24,000 NHDFlowline feature crosses the boundary it
is smoothed at the boundary as to not appear jagged. New and existing NHD Waterbody features that intersect the Indiana
state boundary are digitized across the state boundary. NHDArea features that cross the state boundary are smoothed at
the state boundary to avoid a jagged look. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards
for National Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution (USGS, 1999), available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/."

1 foot, respectively (see Process Description for additional information). Three levels of horizontal positioning QC
were performed, including a self-check, an independent review and a final review. Excluding operator error, horizontal accuracy
is based on the source terrain and imagery data used to create the dataset. All source data (Terrain and Imagery) meets the

The processes used to create and maintain high-resolution NHD data can be found in the table called "NHDMetadata". Because NHD data can be
downloaded using several user-defined areas, the process descriptions can vary for each download. The NHDMetadata table contains a list of
all the process descriptions that apply to a particular download. These process descriptions are linked using the DuuID to the
NHDFeatureToMetadata table which contains the com_ids of all the features within the download. In addition, another table, the
NHDSourceCitation, can also be linked through the DuuID to determine the sources used to create or update NHD data.

The following process was done by subbasin in 2013. Validated the high resolution NHD network connectivity using checks originally
developed to QC the flow network for medium resolution NHDPlus. The QC checks are grouped into the following categories:
Invalid Geometry; Database Integrity; Flow; Spatial; and Feature to Feature rules. Within each of these categories there are
numerous QC checks that assign each potential error a Severity Level of "Severe (1)", "Warning (3)", or "Informational (5)". Each
severe error is corrected before a job is submitted to the NHD Geodatabase. For the Network Improvement project the QC software was
run by HUC-2 (NHD Region) and a report of all the potential errors was created under contract by Horizon Systems, the developer of
the QC software. USGS NGTOC Denver personnel reviewed each HUC-4 (NHD Sub-Region) and identified the errors that needed to be fixed.
Network Improvement editing was done by the USGS NGTOC Denver personnel. See Metadata contact info for details.

The following process was done by subbasin in 2012 and 2013. Create local resolution NHD from the best available DEM and natural
color imagery data available at time of processing. Five-foot DEMs derived either from five foot 2005 ISTAR DEMs, 1.5 meter 2009
Lidar, 1.5 meter 2011 Lidar, 1.5 meter 2012 Lidar, or 1.5 meter 2013 Lidar. Year and resolution of natural color imagery data used
were 1-foot 2005, 6-inch 2005, 1-foot 2011, 6-inch 2011, 1-foot 2012, 6-inch 2012. Six-acre reference streams were created using
the DEMs as the terrain source. Local resolution NHD features were created using these 6 acre streams and the 1:24,000 scale NHD
as a reference, and were adjusted to match the imagery or terrain data, depending upon which provided the most accurate and
up-to-date horizontal location. Conflation was completed using the USGS’ NHD GeoConflation tools. The 1:24,000 scale NHD was used
as the source and the new local resolution NHD was used as the target. Reach codes and associated attributes were conflated from
the 1:24,000 scale NHD features to the local resolution drainage network and 2-D waterbodies. Several checks were performed
to validate the reach transfer process. Any reach codes that could not be maintained are tracked in the ReachCrossReference
table. New reaches that do not exist in the data were defined according to reach delineation rules
(see http://nhd.usgs.gov/chapter1/index.html). New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D lake/pond and reservoir features that
do not exist in the 1:24,000 scale NHD. New reaches were assigned reach code values that are sequentially ordered to 2-D and
then 1-D reaches.  New local resolution reach codes are larger than any existing 1:24,000 reach code in the associated Catalog Unit.

The following process was done by subbasin in 2013: After subbasin is successfully uploaded to USGS NHD geodatabase, the
subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83
Zone 16N; the reprojected features were then loaded into this dataset.

Personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) received an ESRI geodatabase named "NHD_LOCALRES_141106.MDB" from personnel of the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) on November 6, 2014. It was opened in ESRI ArcCatalog and contained the local-resolution NHD polyline
feature class named "NHD_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_IN." The feature class was exported to an ESRI shapefile format and was named
HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_NHD_IN.SHP to follow internal naming conventions of the IGS. It should also be noted that portions of
the metadata provided for the feature class NHD_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_IN were used to construct the metadata document for the shapefile named
HYDROGRAPHY_LOCALRES_FLOWLINE_NHD_IN.SHP.
