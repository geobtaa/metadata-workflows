CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_111TH_USCB_IN.SHP was derived from CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_108TH_USCB_IN.SHP.

CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_111TH_USCB_IN.SHP was derived and modified from a preexisting ESRI shapefile that
was downloaded as a zip file named "cd18_108_shp.zip" (generalized 108th congressional districts) from
the following URL of the U.S. Census Bureau:

The following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to cartographic
boundary files of congressional districts:

"Congressional districts (CDs) are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.
After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is
responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population
to all other CDs in the state as practicable.

The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999.
The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress
(January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained in
effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six
states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five
states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states
(New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the "1998 Congressional
Plan A" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997
plan, "97 House/Senate Plan A," unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. The
Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, "97 House/Senate Plan A," (reflected in
the 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 108th Congress is the
first to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data."

The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau Web document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau
pertaining to cartographic boundary files of congressional districts (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/gen108cd.html):

"These cartographic boundary files are a generalized extract from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database. Very
small polygons were eliminated when the combination of geographic codes existed elsewhere. The geography was clipped
back to the shoreline of the United States, in contrast to TIGER/Line which shows the full extent of geography out to
the 3-mile limit. If detailed 108th Congressional District boundaries are needed, you must use the 108th CD Census
2000 TIGER/Line Files (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrcd108/tgr108cd.html).

Limitations

Because of coordinate thinning:

1. Cartographic boundary files should not be used for geocoding;

2. Some offshore, redundant, zero population and housing land areas may be absent from the files;

3. Cartographic Boundary files are not necessarily vertically integrated with previous boundary file sets."

CD18_108_SHP.ZIP was downloaded from the USCB and unzipped.
ESRI ArcToolBox "Define Projection Wizard" was then used on CD18_108.SHP to define the projection provided, which was Geographic
(Lat/Long) NAD83. ESRI ArcToolBox "Project Wizard" was then used to reproject to UTM Zone 16, NAD83, and the output shapefile
was named CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_108TH_USCB_IN.SHP. ESRI ArcMap was then used to edit the shapefile, and the following fields were
dropped from the attribute table: "Area," "Perimeter," "CD18_108_," "CD18_108_I," "State," "LSAD," "LSAD_TRANS," and "NAME."

The following fields were then added to CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_108TH_USCB_IN.SHP: "Representa," "Party," "Web_Site," "E_Mail,"

A copy of the shapefile named "CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_110TH_USCB_IN.SHP" was opened in ESRI ArcMap. The attributes of the shapefile for
CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_110TH_USCB_IN was then edited in ESRI ArcMap to reflect changes between the 110th and 111th Congresses. The
updated shapefile was then renamed to "CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_111TH_USCB_IN.SHP".

The information listed for Andre Carson (newly elected to the 111th Congress) was obtained from the following URL:
