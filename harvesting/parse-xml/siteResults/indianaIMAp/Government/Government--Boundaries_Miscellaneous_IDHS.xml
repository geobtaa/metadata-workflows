COUNTY_GOVERNMENT_BOUNDARIES_IDHS_IN is an ESRI Geodatabase polygon feature class that contains governmental boundaries maintained by county agencies
in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) as of June 29, 2009, and subsequently updated on September 30, 2009,
December 2, 2009, December 28, 2009, February 2, 2010, March 5, 2010, April 6, 2010, October 11, 2010, November 19, 2010, March 22, 2011, September 8, 2011,

This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI feature class format and was named "County_Govt_Boundary." This data set was compiled by IDHS as part of the
IndianaMap Data Sharing Initiative between IGIC, Indiana Office of Technology (IOT), Indiana Geographic Information Office (GIO), Indiana Department of
Homeland Security (IDHS), Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) and participating Indiana counties to provide the most accurate framework data (including address
points, street centerlines, land parcels, and governmental boundaries) for the citizens of Indiana. More information is available at the following Web URL:

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named "County_Govt_Boundary.shp" from IGIC personnel (Phill Worrall) on May 6, 2013
(harvested on April 27, 2013). The following fields were deleted from the attribute table; "Permanent_Identifier," "Source_FeatureID,"
and "Current_Status." "County_Govt_Boundary.shp" was loaded into ESRI ArcMap 10.1 and the data were examined for completeness.
The shapefile was then exported to an ESRI file geodatabase named COUNTY_GOVERNMENT_BOUNDARIES_IGIC_IN.GDB to conform
to IGS naming conventions.
