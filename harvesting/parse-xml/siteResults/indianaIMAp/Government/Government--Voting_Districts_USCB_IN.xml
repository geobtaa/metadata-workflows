was downloaded as a zip file named "vt18_d00_shp.zip" (voting districts) from the following URL of
the U.S. Census Bureau:

The following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to voting
districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/vt_metadata.html):

"Voting district (VTD) is the generic name for geographic entities, such as precincts, wards, and election
districts, established by state, local, and tribal governments for the purpose of conducting elections. States
participating in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) may provide
boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs to the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported
data for VTDs following the 1980 census. Because the U.S. Census Bureau requires that VTDs follow boundaries
of census blocks, participating states often adjusted the boundaries of the VTDs they submit for data
tabulation purposes to conform to census block boundaries. If requested by the participating state, the U.S. Census Bureau
identifies these "adjusted" VTDs as "pseudo-VTDs."

For Census 2000, each VTD is identified by a one- to six-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within
county. The code "ZZZZZZ" identifies parts of a county in which no VTDs were identified."

VT18_D00_SHP.ZIP was downloaded from the USCB and unzipped.
ESRI ArcToolBox "Define Projection Wizard" was then used on VT18_D00.SHP to define the projection provided, which was Geographic
(Lat/Long) NAD83. ESRI ArcToolBox "Project Wizard" was then used to reproject to UTM Zone 16, NAD83, and the output shapefile
was named VOTING_DISTRICTS_USCB_IN.SHP. ESRI ArcMap was then used to edit the shapefile, and the following fields were
dropped from the attribute table: "Area," "Perimeter," "VT18_D00_," "VT18_D00_I," and "State."

Additionally, a field named "Cnty_Name" was added using the "join tables" function in ESRI ArcMap. The attribute table from
CENSUS_COUNTY_TIGER00_IN.SHP was used for this join.
