"CENSUS_BLOCKGROUPS_TIGER2011_IN: Census Block Group Areas for Indiana in 2011 (United States Census Bureau, 1:100,000, Polygon Shapefile)","CENSUS_BLOCKGROUPS_TIGER2011_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains 2011 census block group boundaries for the state of Indiana.
Census block groups are not legal boundaries, but are considered stable geographic units used for the presentation of decennial census
data.

The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named ""TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau):

""Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block
number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, â¦., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to Block Group 3. As with block groups
delineated for Census 2000, block groups delineated for 5-38 the 2010 Census generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people.
Most block groups were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census
Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could
not identify a potential local participant.

""A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one block group and block groups are uniquely
numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract
boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts,
and American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas.

""Block groups have a valid range of 0 through 9. Block groups beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water
and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial
sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census trac boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau
assigned a default census tract number of 0 and block group of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census
tract areas. Because of updates since 2000, there are 0 block groups that now contain land.""","United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (creator)",20120827,GT-polygon composed of chains,-88.161392,-84.688378,41.781127,37.755397,"ESRI ArcCatalog version 10.1 shapefile format, approximately 19.4 Mb","[u'society', u'boundaries', u'Feature Identifier', u'geographic information system (GIS)', u'United States Department of Commerce', u'United States Census Bureau (USCB)', u'Census Blockgroups', u'Census', u'Statistical Boundary', u'Polygon', u'TIGER/Line', u'Block groups', u'Demographic', u'statistical boundary']"

""Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad

streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city. Census blocks in suburban and
rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and/or transmission line
rights-of-way. In remote areas census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the
United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. A block may consist of one or more faces.

""Blocks never cross county or census tract boundaries (See Figures 3 and 4). They do not cross the boundaries of any entity

Line Featuresroads, railroads, hydrography, and transportation and utility lines.

Boundary Featuresstatistical (e.g., census tracts and blocks); government (e.g., places and counties); and
administrative (e.g., congressional and school districts).

Landmark Featurespoint (e.g., schools and churches); area (e.g., parks and cemeteries); and key geographic locations
(e.g., apartment buildings and factories).

Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs).

Current address range information as reflected in the Master Address File (MAF).

Census tracts are not legal boundaries, but are considered stable geographic units used for the presentation of decennial census data.

The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named ""TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau):

""Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and are reviewed
and updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program.
The Census Bureau updates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined
to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial
census data.

""Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The spatial size
of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tracts are delineated with the intention of being
maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street
patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts
occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.

""Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil
division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit
relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are

"CHILDREN_POVERTY_USCB_IN: Children, Ages 5 to 17, from Families in Poverty in Indiana in 2004, by School
District (United States Census Bureau, 1:500,000, Polygon Shapefile)","Data regarding children (ages 5 to 17) from families in poverty in Indiana in 2004, tabulated by school district,
were obtained from a Web page of the U.S. Census Bureau. These data, which are estimates produced under the Census
Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, were then incorporated into a preexisting
shapefile showing school districts in Indiana, as of 2000. Data that were obtained for each school district included
total population of each district, population of relevant children (ages 5 to 17), and number of children from
families in poverty. A new field, giving the percentage of children in each district that are from families in
poverty, was calculated by dividing the number of children in poverty by the population of relevant children.

The SAIPE data were produced for school districts as they existed in 2005-2006. It was not possible to find a boundary
file for school districts in those years, so a boundary file for 2000 was used. In a few areas, it was not possible to
match the SAIPE data with the 2000 school-district boundaries. This is presumably the result of changes (such as mergers
or divisions) of school districts between 2000 and 2006.

Regarding the preexisting shapefile showing school districts, the following is excerpted from an online document produced
by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html):

""School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational
services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from

the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified.

""The ecoregions shown here have been derived from Omernik (1987) and fr
refinements of Omernik's framework that have been made for other projects.
These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with
the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies,
involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of
reference sites.  Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental
resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and
the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally
similar.  The most immediate needs are to develope regional biological
criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint
source pollution.

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological
regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the
composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences
in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995).  These
phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land
use, wildlife,  and hydrology.  The relative importance of each characteristic
varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical
level.  Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for
different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme
has been adopted for this effort.  Level I is the coarsest level, dividing
North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent
is subdivided into 32 classes.  Level III is the hierarchical level shown on
this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further
subdivided to level IV.  The applications of the ecoregions are explained in
Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and
regional projects.  For additional information, contact James M. Omernik,

""Indiana defines a brownfield site as a parcel of real estate that is abandoned or inactive; or may not be operated at its
appropriate use; and on which expansion, redevelopment, or reuse is complicated; because of the presence or potential
presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum, or a petroleum product that poses a risk to human health
and the environment.

As our undeveloped land continues to disappear, we recognize the need to redevelop and reuse land that may have viable
buildings and infrastructure already present.  The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation
resources can lower the costs to a potential developer.  Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by
rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight.  Because the potential environmental liability
at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup
costs.  Thus, the properties remain idle.  In response to these issues the IDEM, in conjunction with the Indiana
Development Finance Authority,and the Indiana Department of Commerce offers financial assistance in the form of

"SEISMIC_SHAKING_PREDICTED_RESPONSE_RP35_IN: Predicted Responses of Geologic Materials to
Seismically Induced Ground Shaking (Indiana Geological Survey, 1:500,000, Polygon Shapefile)","SEISMIC_SHAKING_PREDICTED_RESPONSE_RP35_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows the distribution and
classification of National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil types. This shapefile represents
the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials
throughout Indiana.

The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground
shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave
velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their
performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil
class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column.

Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5):

A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08.
Note that Class A is not present in Indiana.

B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0.

C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters
per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2.

D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360
meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6.

E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20,
moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification
factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5.

F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick
and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification
factor is not applicable.

The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35:

""The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic
materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft
sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole
methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles
from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh
County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the
potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the
response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana
or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS,
developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess
damage scenarios.

materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a

"Aquifer_Recharge_Near_Surface_IN: Groundwater recharge rates to shallow aquifers, Indiana (Indiana Geological Survey, 100-Meter TIFF Image)","Aquifer_Recharge_Near_Surface_IN is a raster data layer that displays the results of a regression analysis to determine the estimated rate of diffuse groundwater recharge to the water table in shallow aquifers in Indiana based on numerous landscape-level variables as predictors. The goal of this project was to use an objective, reproducible methodology to estimate groundwater recharge rates in both glaciated and driftless environments. This groundwater-recharge raster layer was developed by combining a multiple regression analysis of groundwater recharge with characteristics of near-surface geologic materials. The groundwater recharge data used in the multiple regression analysis was derived from calculations of groundwater baseflow and surface-water runoff for 279 streams in Indiana. Estimates of groundwater base flow were determined using hydrograph separation analysis (Institute of Hydrology, 1980) determined using a local-minimums approach with a recession slope test, and were converted to recharge by multiplying by using estimates of runoff following Wolock (2003). The baseflow index (BFI) provides the proportion of runoff that is assumed to be groundwater contribution, so recharge was estimated as BFI * interpolated statewide runoff (not runoff per basin). The average annual rate of groundwater recharge (in/year) was used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis using ordinary least squares with several landscape and morphometric independent variables representing geologic, terrain, climate, and hydrogeologic characteristics. The regression model developed for Indiana had a global R2 value of 0.50, and the most influential variables at the 95% confidence level were:

- Cumulative percent area of upstream impervious surfaces
- Surface clay thickness
- Percent of clay in soil
- Average annual air temperature
- Presence/absence of unconsolidated aquifers
- Slope of ground surface
- Cumulative percent area of upstream water bodies
- Sand composition of water well boreholes
- Cumulative percent area of upstream medium-height vegetation
- Hydrologic group classification of soil (A,B,C,D - SSURGO)

The following excerpt from the NPS, NRI website describes the eligibility for a
river to be listed-

In order to be listed on the NRI, a river must be free-flowing and
possess one or more Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs). Thus, the
eligibility analysis consists of an examination of the river's hydrology,
including any man-made alterations, and an inventory of its natural,
cultural, and recreational resources. There are a variety of methods to
determine whether certain resources are so unique, rare or exemplary as to
make them outstandingly remarkable. The determination that a river area
contains ORVs is a professional judgment on the part of the
interdisciplinary study team (IDT), based on objective, scientific
analysis. Input from organizations and individuals familiar with specific
river resources should be sought and documented as part of the process.
In order to be assessed as outstandingly remarkable, a river-related value
must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a
comparative regional or national scale. Dictionary definitions of the
words ""unique"" and ""rare"" indicate that such a value would be one that is
conspicuous example from among a number of similar values that are
themselves uncommon or extraordinary. Only one such value is needed for
eligibility.",U.S. National Park Service (Data source),20070521,Complete Chain,-88.1607,-84.6882,41.7753,37.7554,"ESRI ArcGIS 9.2 shapefile format, approximately 765 Kb","[u'inlandWaters', u'environment', u'Nationwide rivers inventory (NRI)', u'\nNational Park Service (NPS)\n', u'outstanding river', u'hydrology', u'river', u'wildlife', u'scenic', u'recreation', u'fishing', u'canoeing', u'history', u'culture', u'geology', u'prehistory', u'\noutstanding river values (ORV)\n']"

March 1 of that year as Information Bulletin #4 in Volume 16, Number 6,
page 1677 through 1680 (sometimes cited as 16 IR 1677). The listing has
also been specifically incorporated by reference into statutes and rules.
Notably, the listing is referenced in the standards for utility line
crossings within floodways, formerly governed by IC 14-28-2 and now
controlled by 310 IAC 6-1-16 through 310 IAC 6-1-18. See, also, the
general permit for logjam removals, implemented as an emergency rule and
pending for adoption as a permanent rule at 310 IAC 6-1-20. Except where
incorporated into a statute or rule, the listing is intended to provide
guidance rather than to have regulatory application.

A special listing was prepared by the division of outdoor
recreation of the department of natural resources. The listing is a
corrected and condensed version of a listing complied by American Rivers
and dated October 1990. There are about 2,000 river miles included on
the listing, a figure which represents less than 9% of the estimated

""This dataset describes the accumulation of chemical contaminants in river,
lake, ocean, and estuary bottoms and includes a screening assessment of
the potential for associated adverse effects on human and environmental
health. EPA evaluated more than 21,000 sampling stations nationwide using
sediment chemistry data, chemical residue levels in edible tissue of aquatic
organisms, and sediment toxicity data. Of the sampling stations evaluated,
5,521 stations were classified as Tier 1 (associated adverse effects are
probable), 10,401 stations were classified as Tier 2 (associated adverse
effects are possible, but expected infrequently), and 5,174 stations were
classified as Tier 3 (no indication of associated adverse effects). Ninety-six
watersheds were identified as areas of probable concern for sediment contamination.
EPA believes that these watersheds represent the highest priority for further
ecotoxicological assessments, risk analysis, temporal and spatial trend
assessments, contaminant source evaluation, and management action because
of the preponderance of evidence in these areas (although further evaluation
is necessary). Also see the related report entitled The Incidence And Severity

Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the principal Federal agency that provides information to the public on the extent and status of the
Nation's wetlands and provides stewardship for the wetlands data that comprise the Wetlands Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure.
In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This
evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data
on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on
the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past
wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No
linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution. Since
these features no longer exist, boundary delineations are considered approximations based on topography, previously mapped information or indications

After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nations critical infrastructure and developed an
acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working
Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different
version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.

""HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold
is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity
datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes.
These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as
disclosure in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the
event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government
organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.

""HSIP Freedom: NGAs goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is
the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach  HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data
to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be
able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.

""The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire
Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS)
was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to
date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities.
Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery.

Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009.
This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named ""2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp.""

The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic
Information Council (IGIC):

""Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP)

After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nations critical infrastructure and developed an
acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working
Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different
version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.

""HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold
is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity
datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes.
These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as
disclosure in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the
event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government
organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.

""HSIP Freedom: NGAs goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is
the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach  HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data
to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be
able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.

""The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire
Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS)
was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to
date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities.
Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery.
TGS incorporates the improved State data into the ""License Free HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate
the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey
for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.""

""Hospitals in Indiana

""The term ""hospital"" means an institution which:

""(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients

"" 	(A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or
"" 	(B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;

""(5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered
professional nurse on duty at all times; ...

""(7) in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals,

"" 	(A) is licensed pursuant to such law or
"" 	(B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing;

The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau
pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs):

""ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary
statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent
either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:

 ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the
addresses within that census block.

 ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPSs ZIP Code delivery areas.

 ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.

 ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.

 ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.

 ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.

 ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are
not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census
2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.

 ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information
and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.

 ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another.""

2006) data set. There are 15 categories of land use shown in this data set
when the associated layer file (LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded.
The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006:

""The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.

For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.

In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.

As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.

Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered ""provisional"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.

Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.

In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.

As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.

Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered ""provisional"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.

""The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.

boundary files of congressional districts:

""Congressional districts (CDs) are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.
After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is
responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population
to all other CDs in the state as practicable.

The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999.
The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress
(January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained in
effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six
states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five
states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states
(New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the ""1998 Congressional
Plan A"" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997
plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. The
Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" (reflected in
the 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 108th Congress is the

""This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project.
The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre
catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and
waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each
feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked
back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS;
the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected
NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a
feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the
nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that
scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail

high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist.
The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named ""NHD_LOCALRES_AREA_IN"":

""This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project.
The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre
catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and
waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each
feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked
back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS;
the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected
NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a
feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the
nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that
scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail
to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at
high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist.
The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for
areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data
Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.""",U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Data author),20161130,GT-polygon composed of chains,-89.183127,-83.047264,46.300193,36.987909,"ESRI ArcGIS version 10.3 shapefile format, approximately 140 Mb","[u'environment', u'inlandWaters', u'stream', u'river', u'inundation area', u'bridge', u'canal', u'ditch', u'dam', u'weir', u'lock chamber', u'rapids', u'spillway', u'submerged stream', u'wash', u'waterbody', u'hydrography', u'hydrology', u'waterbody', u'HUC08 subbasin', u'local resolution (1:2,400)', u'National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)', u'Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)', u'Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)', u'Indiana Geographic Information Office', u'United States Geological Survey (USGS)', u'United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)']"

""This data is presented and maintained for historical purposes. Many other datasets are referenced to this mileage information, and therefore this dataset
is considered by the Division of Water to be the official mileage for these streams.

""Stream mileage maps for streams in Indiana were originally developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Louisville, Detroit and Chicago districts) and
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, from 1965 â 1973. These maps depict stream mileages in tenths of a mile (with exceptions)
mapped on USGS 7 Â½ minute quadrangle maps, at a scale of 1:24000. Methodology for determining stream mileage largely follows the document âRiver Mileage
Measurementâ, Water Resources Council, 1968. Points representing each tenth of a mile were captured by DNR staff using georectified copies of the original
source documents. These points are attributed with the stream name as shown on the original documents, and the basin, from the Division of Water standard
basin schema. This dataset was developed in 2016.

""Updated hydrographic dataset sources (namely the USGS National Hydrography Dataset) are captured to a much finer resolution than was possible when this data
was originally compiled. Additionally, rivers and streams are dynamic, eroding and depositing material and changing course over time, sometimes significantly.
Limitations of this dataset compared to other derivations of stream mileage should be recognized.

""Stream mileage for the Ohio River were taken from the USGS 7 Â½ minute quadrangle maps, and are shown at 1 mile increments. Mileage for the Ohio River is
historically taken as miles from Pittsburgh (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers).

""Discrepancies in the original maps include: Missing mileage data for miles 569-579 for the Ohio River in the Bethlehem quad, an extra 1/10 of a mile between
miles 66.5 and 67 for Sugar Creek in Basin 19, an extra 1/10 of a mile between miles 17.5 and 18 for Middle Fork Blue River in Basin 27, an extra 1/10 of a
mile between miles 17.5 and 18 for Little Calumet River in Basin 1.""","Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water",20160930,Entity point,-88.053665,-84.757516,41.763888,37.815204,"Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise, ESRI ArcCatalog 10.3, Approximately 12.9 Mb","[u'environment', u'inlandWaters', u'stream mileage', u'streams', u'rivers', u'hydrology', u'water body']"
